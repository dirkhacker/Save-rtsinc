<p>As a member of RTS Carrier Services, you can save hundreds of dollars by purchasing industry-leading Transflo electronic logging devices (ELDs). These devices address compliance with the new DOT rule that requires most commercial truck drivers to track their hours of service with ELDs.</p>
 
<h2>Save $99 On Each ELD</h2>
RTS Carrier Services members can sign up for a two-year ELD contract that <strong>waives the equipment fees on Transflo ELDs--a savings of $99 for each device</strong>.
 
<h2>Your Choice of Two Products</h2>
Transflo offers competitive pricing on two leading ELD systems. Both products will keep your trucks on the road once the ELD mandate takes effect:
 
<h2>Transflo Standard ELD - $25 per month, per device</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hours-of-service logging that addresses compliance with the ELD rule</li>
<li>IFTA mileage collection and reporting information</li>
<li>Driver vehicle inspection reporting for law enforcement (pre- and post-trip)</li>
<li>Basic GPS tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transflo Fleet Telematics - $35 per month, per device</h2>

Includes everything in the Transflo Standard ELD, plus the following features:
<ul>
<li>Ultra-accurate vehicle diagnostics and data (miles-per-gallon, engine performance, service warnings, etc.)</li>
<li>Map-based truck tracking using GPS locations</li>
<li>Accident detection and reconstruction capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
<ul>
<li>Click <a href=""http://www.transflo.com/transflo-telematics-for-rts-carrier-services-customers/"">here</a> to complete the Transflo ELD application.</li></li>
<li>A Transflo representative will contact you to handle the ELD contract, payments and other paperwork.</li>
<li>Once you return the ACH form, the ELD device will be shipped directly to your mailing address.</li>
<li>For installation help and customer support, contact Transflo at (813) 386-2378.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More About ELDs</h2>

The federal ELD mandate applies to most, but not all, trucking companies. To learn more about what your company needs to do to comply with the rule, read our free article, <a href=""https://www.rtscarrierservices.com/articles/one-year-away-how-will-eld-mandate-affect-your-business"">""How Will the ELD Mandate Affect Your Business?""</a>
