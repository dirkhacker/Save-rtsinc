<h2 class=""margin-top-0"">Financing That Makes Your Company Stronger</h2>

<p>If your company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, you might believe that there are no longer any financing options available for you. However, you can still maintain your cash flow by factoring your company’s receivables.</p>

<p>Factoring is among the most cost-effective, flexible forms of financing available to companies that are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, also known as ""debtor-in-possession."" Here are some of the advantages of factoring with RTS Financial:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You keep cash coming in while your company reorganizes.</li>
	<li>Increased cash flow makes it easier to pay employees and meet customer demands.</li>
	<li>Unlike other financing, factoring puts more weight on your customers’ ability to pay than on your company’s credit history.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Factoring Works in Four Simple Steps:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Your company completes a customer order.</li>
	<li>You send your invoice to RTS Financial.</li>
	<li>You receive early payment on your invoice from RTS Financial.</li>
	<li>RTS Financial collects full payment from your customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The RTS Financial Difference:</h2>

<p>As a member of the <a href=""https://turnaround.org"">Turnaround Management Association (TMA)</a>, RTS Financial has served many debtor-in-possession companies over the years. Below are some of the key benefits of factoring with RTS Financial:  
</p><ul>
	<li>Same-day funding</li>
	<li>Highly competitive advance rates with no hidden fees</li>
	<li>Online account access and easy uploading of documents</li>
	<li>Free collections and other back-office services</li>
	<li>Access to funding is based on your customers’ credit, not your company’s credit or business history</li>
	<li>As your company grows, the cash flow from factoring matches that growth</li>
</ul>

245,0,Industry,Government Contractors ,Government Contractors ,"<h2 class=""margin-top-0"">Why Wait to Get Paid by the Government?</h2>

<p>Performing contract work for government agencies can lead to steady, reliable income for your company. The federal government alone paid out $439 billion last year across more than 31,000 contracts. Federal law requires that at least 23% of that contract work go to small businesses.</p> 

<p>The problem is that government agencies can wait as long as 120 days to pay their vendors. This can hurt your company’s cash flow, making it more difficult to pay your employees and suppliers. You likely have already waited months to win the bid on a government contract. Why wait months longer to get paid?</p>

<h2>Same-Day Payments on Receivables</h2> 

<p>One solution is RTS Financial’s Early Pay program. We fund your government receivables within 24 hours, making it easier to build cash flow, meet expenses and grow your business.</p>

<p>With more than 20 years in the business of funding receivables, RTS Financial assists a wide range of companies that perform contract and subcontract work for local, state and federal government agencies. With Early Pay, your company builds cash flow instead of waiting to be paid for your contract work. </p>


<h2>How Early Pay Works in Four Simple Steps:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You complete a service for a government agency.</li>
<li>You send your paperwork to RTS Financial.</li>
<li>You receive early payment on your invoice from RTS Financial.</li>
<li>RTS Financial collects full payment from the government.</li>
</ul>

<li>Free collections and other back-office services</li>
<li>Access to funding is based on the government's credit, not your company's credit or business history</li>
<li>As your contract work increases, the cash flow from RTS Financial matches your company’s growth</li>
