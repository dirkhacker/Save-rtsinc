<p>Here is the accounts receivable financing process, explained in five simple steps:</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Step 1: Generate an Invoice.</strong> Your company sells products to a company based in the U.S. or Canada. Once the title has transferred to the buyer, you generate an invoice for the sale.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 2: Sell Your Invoice to RTS Financial.</strong> Instead of waiting 30, 60 or 90 days for payment from your customer, your company sells the invoice to us.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 3: Receive Funding.</strong> RTS Financial purchases the invoice and advances between 80% and 90% of the total invoice value to your company. RTS Financial holds the balance in reserve.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 4: Customer Collection.</strong> RTS Financial collects the full balance of the invoice from your company’s customer.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 5: Completion.</strong> RTS Financial returns the reserve balance to your company, minus a fee for assuming the collections risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accounts Receivable Financing Versus Traditional Bank Lending</h2>

<p class=""first"">Accounts receivable financing is not a loan. The provided capital is based on the credit of your customers, not your balance sheet. This is an excellent alternative to traditional bank lending as you gain immediate cash flow without assuming new debt. More and more exporting companies are using our services for this reason.</p>

<p>Make sure you understand a factoring company's fee structure. Beware of ""hidden"" fees that cover money transfers, software, collateral and other business costs. Ask if the factor charges only a flat fee, which is a percentage of your total invoice value. Be prepared to negotiate the removal of these fees if they exist.</p> 

<h2>Bad Customer Service</h2>
Make sure you can call your account representative directly when you need information. Lousy customer service is a leading reason why companies leave their factoring provider. When talking with a factoring company, ask for a dedicated, single-point-of-contact to manage and answer questions about your account. 

<h2>Limited Funding That Hampers Growth</h2>
<p>Before entering into a factoring agreement, make sure the factor has enough financial resources to continue funding your invoices as your company and receivables grow.</p> 

<h2>No Access to Aging or Reserve Reports</h2>
<p>Some factoring companies make it difficult for you to see your account information. Make sure you can access your account balance, aging and reserve reports online. This is critical information you need to run your business effectively.</p>

<h2>Being Forced to Fax Documents</h2>
<p>Many factoring companies still require their customers to provide original documents for each transaction. Look for a factoring company that allows you to easily upload invoices and other documents online.</p>",,,,,English,,,,,,,1,admin,1486137494,,/lp/factoring-mistakes,1,1,0,,,,,Webster,,

275,0,Landing Page,How to Solve Cash Flow Problems Without a Loan,How to Solve Cash Flow Problems Without a Loan,"<p>Cash is the lifeblood of any business. Your company may be the best as what it does, customers may be lining up for your product or services. Without adequate cash flow, however, you can’t pay your employees, meet operating expenses, or fund an expansion of your business.</p> 

<p>How do you build up cash while waiting 30, 60 or even 90 days on customer payments? A bank line of credit is a possibility, but the application process can take weeks and involve a lot of paperwork.</p> 

With traditional financing, you also incur debt. A credit line might meet your short-term cash needs, but the debt it adds to your balance sheet can hurt your business later.

<h2>A Debt-Free Solution</h2>

Many companies choose to build up their cash flow by factoring their receivables. Unlike a bank loan, factoring involves no debt. The funding you receive through factoring is your money—you are just receiving it weeks earlier than you would by waiting on customer payments.  

Factoring is also scalable, meaning the amount of funding grows as your company’s receivables grow.   

<h2>How Factoring Works in Five Steps:</h2>
<ol>
<li>You complete a service or deliver a product to a customer.</li>
<li>You send the invoice to a factoring company, also known as a “factor.” The factor sends the invoice to your customer.</li>
<li>The factor advances your company 80% to 90% of the invoice value.</li>
<li>Your customer pays the factor the full value of the invoice. The factor pays you the reserve balance, minus a fee.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Benefits of Factoring</h2>

In addition to being debt-free, factoring is fast. Most factors advance funding on your invoices within 24 hours.  Here are some other ways factoring can benefit your business. 
<ul>
<li>Most factors provide free back-office support, including managing collections from your customers.</li>
<li>Factoring is based on the quality of your customers’ credit, not your own credit or business history.</li>
<li>Funding through factoring grows as your receivables grow.</li>
<li>Factoring can be customized and managed so that it provides necessary capital when your company needs it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides consumers (California residents only) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Right to Know and Data Portability</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (the ""right to know""). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete), we will disclose to you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
	<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
	<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
	<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
	<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</li>
	<li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
	<li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
	<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not provide a right to know or data portability disclosure for B2B personal information.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Right to Delete</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the ""right to delete""). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete), we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
	<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
	<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
	<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
	<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).</li>
	<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
	<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
	<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
	<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ol>

<p>We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and will direct our service providers to take similar action.</p>

<p>We do not provide these deletion rights for B2B personal information.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete</strong></p>

<p>To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request by either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Emailing us at legalnotices@rtsfinancial.com</li>
	<li>By mail at RTS Financial Service, Inc., Legal Dept., 9300 Metcalf Avenue, Overland Park, KS 66212.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requests submitted by mail or email must have both “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line or heading and an assertion that you are a California resident, otherwise the request will not be considered valid. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information.</p>

<p>You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information.</li>
	<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>

<p>You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></p>

<p>We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please forward your original request to legalnotices@rtsfinancial.com.</p>

<p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>

<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

	<li>Cumplir con una obligación legal.</li>

<p> </p>

<p>Solo puede enviar una solicitud de información dos veces en un período de 12 meses. Su solicitud de saber o eliminar debe:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Describir su solicitud con suficiente detalle que nos permita comprenderla, evaluarla y responderla adecuadamente.</li>

<p>No podemos responder a su solicitud ni brindarle información personal si no podemos verificar su identidad o autoridad para realizar la solicitud y confirmar que la información personal se relaciona con usted.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>No cobramos una tarifa para procesar o responder a su solicitud de consumidor verificable a menos que sea excesiva, repetitiva o evidentemente infundada. Si determinamos que la solicitud justifica una tarifa, le informaremos por qué tomamos esa decisión y le proporcionaremos un costo estimado antes de completar su solicitud.</p>
