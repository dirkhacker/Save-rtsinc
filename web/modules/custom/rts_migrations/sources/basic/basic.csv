<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
</div>

<p>RTS Financial Service, Inc. and RTS Carrier Services, Inc. (collectively, “us”, “we,” and “RTS”) value our customers, their information, privacy and trust.  This Policy explains how we collect, use and protect your information through our websites and mobile applications. Specifically, this Policy applies to RTS’ collection, use, storage, and transfer of information associated with RTS’ sites, <a href=""http://www.rtsinc.com"">www.rtsinc.com</a>, and <a href=""http://www.pro-transport.com"">www.pro-transport.com</a> (collectively, “Sites”) and our mobile applications including  RTS Pro and Load Management (“Apps”)). If there is something you do not understand about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at <a href=""mailto:legalnotices@rtsfinancial.com"">legalnotices@rtsfinancial.com</a>.    </p>

<p>Throughout this Policy, we refer to the term “Personal Information”. <strong>“Personal </strong><strong>Information</strong><strong>”</strong> is data about an individual who can be identified from that data or by combining it with other data.  Personal Information is usually your name in combination with another identifier, such as date of birth, postal address, email address, telephone number, or government-issued identification number.  The specific definition of Personal Information varies from one jurisdiction to another. </p>

<p>Personal Information does not include anonymous or aggregated data that can no longer be used to identify a specific person, even if combined with other data.</p>

<p>Many of our customers are businesses, rather than individuals.  We do not consider Business Information, such as one’s position, business name, title, generic business email, business phone number, business address, business fax, and other similar business information, to be Personal Information.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information Collected Directly from You</strong></p>

<p>We may collect your first and last name, your company, your email address, phone number and monthly business volume when you sign up to receive information about our products or services, request a price quote, or voluntarily submit other information to us. We use this information to provide the requested information.</p>

<p>When you report a problem with our Sites or services, we will collect your name, email address, and phone number, along with a description of your problem so that we may address your problem. When you contact us via the company email address, we will collect your email address and any information you include in your email to similarly address your concerns.</p>

<p>We collect your full name, address, phone number, and email address when you create an account on our Sites. When you register for or use the Apps, we collect your name, address, email address, phone number, your unique account ID, as well as information about your business such as your company’s name, company size, and business type. We use this information to confirm your registration initially and to confirm your identity when you later log in to your account. We also use this information to confirm your registration, respond to customer service requests, administer your account, improve the operation of our application, improve the operation of our Sites and Apps, conduct research and analysis of how our customers use our Sites and mobile application, and assess which of our products and services may be of interest to you. We will keep this information for as long as you have an account with us to allow us to verify your identity and to provide you with the account information you request. In addition, we may retain Personal Information from closed accounts to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any moneys owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Use or contractual rights, and take other reasonable actions permitted or required by applicable law.</p>

<p>In the absence of a legal obligation to the contrary, we keep your contact information for a year after your last contact with us. </p>

<p>Our Sites are not directed to children under age 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  Children under 13 should not provide their Personal Information to us through our Sites, to customer service, or in writing.  If we learn that Personal Information belonging to anyone under the age of 13 is stored on the Sites, we will immediately delete such information and refrain from using it for any purpose.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Other Information We Collect </strong></p>

<p>In addition to collecting information directly from you as described in the previous section, we also automatically gather information when you browse or view our Sites or use our Apps. For the Sites, this information may include Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and other information related to your visit. Our Sites may also use a website screen recording service that may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling. The information collected does not include any Personal Information, bank details, or any sensitive personal data. Data collected by this service is used to improve our Sites usability. The information collected is stored and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting and is not shared with anybody else.<b><i> </i></b>For Apps, this information may include the type of phone or other mobile device you are using, the duration and frequency of your usage sessions, information regarding application crashes and screens you chose to view, gestures (i.e., taps, swipes, pinches, etc.) you use on the application, whether you are a first-time or a returning user, links you clicked on while in the application, and your flow and navigation path through the application. </p>

<p>We use this browsing information to make sure that the Sites and Apps, and their associated parts, are functioning properly, that the Sites and Apps are displayed properly for your equipment and software, and that we can provide you with information useful to your location. </p>

<p>There are “do not track” or similar browser choices available to internet users with respect to online web activity but given the present lack of consensus of what constitutes an informed election, appropriate trigger or breadth of scope of such choice, our Sites will not operate any differently when a “do not track” signal is received.</p>

<p>In some of our email messages, you will find a “click-through URL” linked to content on our Sites.  We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click such links in our email messages.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>

<p>We use technologies such as “cookies” and pixel tags so we can remember certain information about you, remember your preferences or recognize you when you return.  They also help us compile aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interaction so that we can improve our Sites and protect our Sites from fraud.</p>

<p>A cookie is a text file that is stored on your computer.  As text files, cookies cannot read information on your hard drive, run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  </p>

<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies automatically. You can set your browser to decline all cookies automatically or to prompt you for a response each time a cookie is offered. If you decline cookies, you may find that you cannot access all of our Site’s features.</p>

<p>During your browsing session, we use “session” cookies to store information and monitor Site function.  For thirty minutes after your session, a cookie tracks the number of visitors to our Sites.  Until midnight of the day after your last session, a cookie tracks the number of times you visit the Sites.  For two weeks after your last session, a cookie retains the items you have place in the Sites’ cart, in case you leave without purchasing and then return to make the purchase.  There is a permanent cookie used to remember your password. </p>

<p>Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs, are often used in combination with cookies. Often transparent, these images are part of web pages, and allow us to count users who have visited certain pages and to generate statistics about how our Sites are used. They are not used to access Personal Information. </p>

<p>We also use log files when you visit our Sites. Log files track IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP) identity, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the Sites and Apps, prevent fraud, track website navigation in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<p>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers. </p>

<p><meta charset=""utf-8"" />Pixel tags such as the Facebook pixel and LinkedIn pixel are also used on our website to collect information to better serve advertisements which are relevant to your interests.</p>

<p><strong>Google Adwords, Google Analytics, and Third-Party Software/Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>We use Google Adwords and Google Analytics in connection with our Sites to gather data such as age, gender and interests to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences.</p>

<p>Google Adwords and similar programs from other companies help us target our online ads based on information collected directly from you or by automated means, like cookies. These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  </p>

<p>You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored to your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at <a href=""http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at <a href=""http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/"">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a>  </p>

<p>Google Analytics collects anonymous information that is not used to identify a particular user.  This information helps us better understand how visitors use our Sites, detect and defend against fraud and other security risks, and present advertisements, products, and/or services of interest to you.</p>

<p>To learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, located at <a href=""http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. To learn about how to opt-out of Google Analytics, please visit <a href=""http://tools.Google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"">http://tools.Google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p>

<p>We may use certain analytics solutions that may record screens visited, interaction patterns (such as screen actions, gestures, taps, and scrolls) and device details (type, version, model, and operating system). We are using the information collected to improve our app and will not collect personally identifiable information or track your browsing habits across apps.</p>

By completing the online registration process, you confirm and affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Mobile Terms. If you do not agree to these terms, or are incapable of complying with them, do not use the App.</p>

<h2><strong>Ownership, License & Restrictions on Use</strong></h2>

<p>The entire content of the App, including but not limited to text, graphics, user interfaces, visual interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, sounds, music, artwork, and computer code, programs, tools, and the design, structure, coordination, expression, “look and feel” and arrangement of such content (collectively, “App Content”) is owned controlled, or licensed by or to RTS. Your use of the App does not grant you any rights to any of the App Content or to any content incorporated into the App owned by RTS’ third-party vendors or partners.</p>

<p>RTS grants you a personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive limited license to download, install, access and use the App for your personal and internal business purposes only and strictly in accordance with these Mobile Terms. These terms further apply to and govern any upgrades provided by RTS that replace and/or supplement the version of the App that you initially download, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. In the event of a conflict between the Mobile Terms and any other agreement, these Mobile Terms shall control. All rights not expressly granted in the Mobile Terms are reserved for RTS.</p>

<p>You may not distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. Except where expressly permitted, you may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or license the App or the App Content. You may not copy, adapt, distribute, transfer, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, exploit, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the App, any updates, or any part thereof except as expressly permitted herein.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not engage in conduct or communications in connection with the App that are: (a) obscene, fraudulent, indecent, defamatory, abusive, harassing, or threatening to others, or negatively impacts others’ ability to use the Sites; (b) contain any viruses, malware, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, or other disabling devices or other harmful component intended to or that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data, or personal information; (c) advocate or encourage any illegal activity; (d) infringe on the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity, or other intellectual property or proprietary right of any third party; (e) violate the privacy of individuals, including, but not limited to, other users of the Site; (f) engage in, assist, or encourage any conduct, activities, or communications that affect the operation, access, or usability of the Site for any other authorized user; or (g) violate any applicable local, state, national or international law.</p>

<p>You also agree that you will not (h) attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the App or our systems, networks or servers by hacking, password “mining” or any other illegitimate means.  We reserve the right to bar any such activity or use in our discretion.</p>

<p>We may make improvements, changes, or amendments to the information, services, products, and other materials in the App, or terminate the App at any time in our sole discretion. At some point we may update the App. While the App is currently available on Android and iOS, the requirements for both operating systems (and for any additional operating systems on which we may decide to offer the App) may change, requiring you to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. You promise to always accept updates to the App when offered. The decision to develop and offer, or not offer, updates to the App belongs solely to us.</p>

<p>We may modify the Mobile Terms at any time, and such modifications will be effective immediately upon posting. You should periodically agree to review the Mobile Terms as your continued access to or use of the App will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Mobile Terms.</p>

<p>Your license to use the App is effective until terminated by you or RTS for any reason. If you breach any of these Mobile Terms, your rights under these Mobile Terms will terminate automatically without notice from RTS. Upon termination of your license, you shall cease all use of the App and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the App. Furthermore, we reserve the right to terminate your access to, and use of, the App at any time, with or without cause, in our sole discretion and you agree that we are not, and cannot be, liable to you, or any third party, for the removal or disabling of access to, or use of, the App.</p>

<h2><strong>Consent to Use of Data</strong></h2>

<p>You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about the device you use to access the App. We may also collect information about the system and application software you use as well as information about device peripherals you employ. And we may collect information about your activities on the App, like the duration and frequency of your usage sessions, information regarding application crashes and screens you chose to view, gestures (i.e., taps, swipes, pinches, etc.) you use on the application, whether you are a first-time or a returning user, links you clicked on while in the application, and your flow and navigation path through the application. This information is gathered periodically and facilitates the development of software updates, the provision of product support, and with the delivery of other services to you (if any) related to the App. We may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve our products or to provide services or technologies to you. More information on the collection and use of this information, as well as other information we may collect from you through the App can be found in our <a href=""/page/privacy-policy"">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Third-Party Services and Materials</strong></h2>

<p>The App may enable access to third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of the Services may require internet access and your acceptance of additional terms of service. Certain Services may display, include, or make available content, data, information, applications, or materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third-party websites. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright, compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or websites. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials, or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you.</p>

<p>You agree that Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except as authorized in these Mobile Terms.

<p>In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to from your mobile device or PC are not available in all languages or in all countries. We make no representations that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location.

We and our licensors, reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will we be liable for the removal or disabling of access to any such Services. We may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.</p>

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall our total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

<h2><strong>Indemnification</strong></h2>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold RTS and its affiliates, partners, agents and subsidiaries, harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney’s fees that arise from your use or misuse of the App or the App Content, or by your conduct that would constitute a breach of any of these Mobile Terms by you.

<p>If any of these terms will be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term.</p>

<p>You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under the Mobile Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without RTS’ prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Mobile Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.

279,0,Basic page,How Factoring Builds Working Capital and Fuels Business Growth,How Factoring Builds Working Capital and Fuels Business Growth,"<h2 class=""margin-top-0"">How Does Factoring Work?</h2>
<p>Factoring is a transaction in which a business sells its invoices, or receivables, to a third-party financial company known as a “factor.” The factor then collects payment on those invoices from the business’s customers. Factoring is known in some industries as “accounts receivable financing.”</p>
<p>The main reason that companies choose to factor is that they want to receive cash quickly on their receivables, rather than waiting the 30 to 60 days it often takes a customer to pay. Factoring allows companies to quickly build up their cash flow, which makes it easier for them to pay employees, handle customer orders and add more business.</p>

<h2>What is a Cash Advance?</h2>
<p>When you factor an invoice, the factoring provider advances to you a percentage of that invoice value, usually within 24 hours. The factor will then pay you the balance of the invoice, minus fees, after it collects payment from your customer.  
The cash advance rate can vary depending on what industry your company is in and whom you choose as a factor. The advance rate can range from 80% of an invoice value to as much as 95%. Your industry, your customers’ credit histories and other criteria help determine the advance rate you receive.</p>
      
<h2>Why Not Just Wait for My Customers to Pay?</h2>
<p>The long wait on customer payments can limit the amount of cash your company has on hand to meet expenses and achieve financial goals. 
While there are many advantages to factoring, the main benefit is quick payment on your invoices. Let’s say, for example, that your company averages $100,000 in receivables each month. However, you have nothing to show for it at month’s end because your customers wait longer than 30 days to pay. Factoring ensures that you receive cash on those invoices immediately. Even at an 80% advance rate, your business can count on having $80,000 in the bank at month’s end, instead of zero.</p>
           
<h2>Factoring in Five Simple Steps</h2>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/illustrated-guide-how-factoring-works"">simple graphic illustrates</a> how a factoring transaction typically works.</p>
      
<h2>What Are Some Other Benefits of Factoring?</h2>
<p>Boosting cash flow is the main reason most companies factor. However, factoring provides many other advantages as well. Here are a few of them: 
</p><ul>  
<li>Factors provide free back-office support, including managing collections from your customers. This gives you more time and resources to focus on growing your company.</li>
<li>Factoring is based on the quality of your customers’ credit, not your own credit or business history.</li>
<li>Factoring can be customized and managed so that it provides necessary capital when your company needs it.</li>
<li>Factoring is not a loan, so you do not incur debt when you factor.</li>
<li>Factoring is scalable, meaning the amount of funding can grow as your receivables grow. </li>
</ul>
      
<h2>What Kinds of Companies Factor?</h2>
<p>Companies of all sizes, from one-person businesses, to Fortune 500 corporations, use factoring as a way to increase their cash flow. Factoring spans all industries, including trucking, transportation, manufacturing, government contracting, textiles, oilfield services, health care and staffing agencies. Companies use the cash generated from factoring to pay for inventory, buy new equipment, add employees and expand operations—basically any expenses related to their business. Factoring allows a company to make quicker decisions and expand at a faster pace.</p>
      
<h2>How Long Has Factoring Been Around?</h2>
<p>Factoring actually <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/brief-history-factoring-accounts-receivable-financing"">goes back many centuries</a>. The origin of factoring lies in overseas trade among nations. It became a part of doing business in England as early as the 1400s, and came to America with the Pilgrims in 1620. Like all financial tools, factoring has evolved over the years. It grew in the United States as an effective way for companies to build more cash flow, due to limitations companies faced securing loans in the nation’s fragmented banking system.</p>
      
<h2>How Much Do I Need to Factor?</h2>
<p>It depends on your company’s unique business needs. Some companies factor all of their invoices, while others factor only invoices for customers that take a longer time to pay. The volume of receivables that a company may choose to factor can range from a few thousand dollars to millions of dollars a month.</p>

<h2>Factoring versus a Traditional Bank Loan</h2>
<p class=""medium"">Factoring, or “accounts receivable financing,” is a quick, flexible way for businesses to build up their cash flow. Here is how factoring differs from a bank business loan or line of credit:</p>
<div class=""bvf-header-container"">
<h3 class=""bvf-header bvf-factoring"">Factoring</h3>
<h3 class=""bvf-header bvf-banking"">Bank Loan</h3>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-1"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">The amount of money you can finance grows as your receivables grow.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">The money you borrow comes with a cap or a limit.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-2"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">Factoring is not a loan. You assume no debt.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">You repay principal and interest on your loan.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-3"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">You can qualify for factoring regardless of your credit score; most factors are more concerned with your customers’ credit strength.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">Qualifying for a loan requires a review of your company’s financials, assets and liabilities, and credit history.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-4"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">It can take less than five days to set up an account.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">Securing a loan or line of credit takes between one and two months.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-5"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">Funding can take place within 24 hours.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">Once your loan is approved, you have immediate access to those funds.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-6"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">Minimal paperwork and documentation are required to start factoring.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">Extensive paperwork, financial statements and personal information are required.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-7"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">Some factors handle collections of your accounts receivable and provide additional back-office services.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">No accounts receivable or back office services are provided.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-8"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">Rates can be adjusted as you finance more money through factoring.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">Your annual percentage rate is locked long-term, or for the life of the loan.</div>
</div>
<div class=""bvf-row row-9"">
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-factoring"">Some factors provide credit reports and other information on your existing and potential customers.</div>
<div class=""bvf-item bvf-item-banking"">No credit services provided, which means you manage your own credit policy.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>What is the Difference Between Recourse and Non-Recourse Factoring?</h2>
<p>Recourse factoring means that the factoring client ultimately takes responsibility for payment of an invoice if the factor cannot collect payment from the customer, or debtor.</p>
<p>Non-recourse factoring allows companies to sell their invoices to the factoring company, which assumes all of the credit risks for collecting on the invoices. Some factoring providers offer both recourse and non-recourse factoring to their clients.</p>
<h2>What about Fees or Contract Terms?</h2>
<p>Different factors have different fee structures. Some only charge an overall factoring fee that is determined by the monthly volume of receivables and the creditworthiness of a client’s customers. Other factoring providers have additional fees that cover money transfers, shipping, collateral and other costs of doing business.</p>
<p>When selecting a factor, pay close attention to the fee structure. Make sure the factor you work with is up-front with you about its fees as well as the term of the factoring contract. Most factoring contracts are 12 months with annual renewals.</p>
      
<h2>Is Credit Insurance Needed on Debtors?</h2>
      <p>Insurance is not typically necessary, but may be required in specific circumstances.</p>

<h2 class=""subheading1"">Our broker credit ratings provide our carrier network with real-time credit data on more than 70,000 brokers and shippers.</h2>

<p>See below for answers to frequently asked questions about your RTS Credit Rating.</p>

<h4>How is my credit rating calculated?</h4>

<p>Our credit ratings are primarily derived from first-hand payment experiences compiled by our factoring company, RTS Financial. In addition to this payment information, we may consider available financial statements, bank/trade references and additional information from the FMCSA.</p>

<h4>Why am I even in the system?</h4>

<p>Every shipper or broker with an MC number registered with the FMCSA is automatically uploaded to our database and initially given an “N” rating, meaning they are not yet rated.</p>

<h4>Is an N rating bad?</h4>

<p>No. An N rating is considered factorable for many of the carriers in our network and is not indicated as good or bad. The “N” rating simply means we have not yet received the number of required closed invoices to establish a rating.</p>

<h4>How can I establish my credit rating?</h4>

<p>To establish an RTS Credit Rating, we require a minimum of three invoices paid to RTS Financial’s factoring clients. Shippers and brokers can begin the process by filling out the credit application below. This information helps RTS Credit better determine your credit rating for our carrier network.</p>

<div class=""btn blue-outline margin-top-20 margin-bottom-40"">
  <a href=""/sites/default/files/RTS%20Financial%20Credit%20App.pdf"">CREDIT APPLICATION</a>
</div>

<h4>Will you tell your carriers to work with me?</h4>

<p>It is important to know that RTS Credit does not advise its carriers on whether to take loads from a shipper or broker. Instead, our credit ratings are a tool that indicate risk depending on how many days it takes a shipper or broker to close invoices with RTS Financial.</p>

<h4>What do the credit ratings mean?</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>N</strong> means no credit rating has been established. To establish an RTS Credit Rating, we require a minimum of three paid invoices with RTS Financial’s factoring clients.</li>
	<li><strong>A</strong> is excellent. Payment average is at net 21 days or faster and/or RTS Credit has received strong financial information.</li>
	<li><strong>B</strong> is above average. Payment average is at net 21 days or faster (plus mail time).</li>
	<li><strong>C</strong> is average. Payment average is at net 30 days (plus mail time). We consider this to be the industry standard and our most common rating.</li>
	<li><strong>D</strong> is below average. Payment average is after net 30 days through net 45 days (plus mail time).</li>
	<li><strong>F</strong> is poor. Payment average is after net 45 days (plus mail time).</li>
	<li><strong>I</strong> is ineligible for factoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>We update our credit information daily to ensure accuracy. We constantly review our credit scoring practices to make sure our reports are as detailed as possible and reflect any changes in the industry.</p>

<p>Last Updated on 5/31/2016</p>

<p>These Terms and Conditions are attached to and form a part of the RTS Plus Network Merchant Agreement between the parties. The RTS Plus Network Merchant Agreement and these Terms and Conditions are hereinafter referred to together as the “Agreement” and such terms and conditions shall be automatically incorporated into the Agreement as of the date and time it was executed by the parties:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Provider hereby acknowledges and agrees that as part of the Incentives RTS does not and will never (i) purchase or sell, take title in any manner, or assume any liability whatsoever relating to the purchase of the fuel and related items (the “Goods”) by RTS Customers from Provider’s locations, (ii) take delivery of, inspect, dispose of, or do anything in relation to the manufacture or delivery of the Goods, (iii) calculate, collect or remit any taxes relating to the purchase of such Goods, (iv) provide any warranties, insurance or liability protections relating to the Goods, and (v) be deemed a lender or have any financial responsibility for payment on any Goods purchased by RTS Customers.</li>
	<li>During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement, it is agreed that Provider shall not: (i) divert or attempt to divert any RTS Customer to another fueling or related program, or (ii) communicate, divulge, or use for the benefit of any party any information or knowledge concerning the business and operations of RTS and the RTS Customers, or any item, of which Provider may be apprised by virtue of its activities under this Agreement unless approved in writing by RTS. The parties acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section would be inadequate and therefore agree that RTS shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach.</li>
	<li>Provider hereby agrees that (i) RTS shall not be liable for any taxes, fees, penalties or other costs associated with each transaction by an RTS Customer, and (ii) RTS’ aggregate liability to Provider and third parties arising out of this Agreement shall never exceed $1,000 during any term or extended term.</li>
	<li>Provider hereby agrees that WEX may share pricing data with RTS that includes, but shall not be limited to; freight rate, taxes, OPIS rack pricing and retail prices. Cost Plus pricing will be calculated based on cost components supplied by Provider in the RTS Plus Network Merchant Agreement. Pricing will be based on OPIS rack average for the previous business day plus the aforementioned cost components.</li>
	<li>Except as otherwise provided herein, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years from the termination of this Agreement, the party receiving any proprietary or confidential information concerning the business, software, service, products or customers of the other party, (collectively, the ""Confidential Information""), will not disclose such Confidential Information and shall exercise the same degree of care to avoid disclosure of such Confidential Information as it employs with respect to its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care. Confidential Information shall not include such information that: (a) is now or hereafter becomes publicly known without violation of this Agreement; (b) was known to the recipient prior to the time of disclosure without obligation to preserve confidentiality and as evidenced by the recipient's written records; (c) was received by the recipient from a third party legally entitled to disclose the information without obligation to preserve confidentiality; (d) was independently developed by the recipient; (e) is authorized to be disclosed by the disclosing party or is required to be disclosed by law in which case the recipient will inform the disclosing party and allow the disclosing party reasonable time to seek a protective order. </li>
	<li>In order to protect and prevent disclosures of the Confidential Information of the other party, each party shall not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Confidential Information of the other party except (1) as required for each Party to perform its obligations hereunder; or (2) as preapproved in writing by the party disclosing the Confidential Information.</li>
	<li>Any Confidential Information shall remain the disclosing party's property unless otherwise provided herein. The Parties acknowledge that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of these confidentiality provisions would be inadequate and therefore agree that either party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in case of any such breach or threatened breach. Upon termination of this Agreement, the parties shall, as directed by each other, either return or destroy all Confidential Information (in tangible and intangible form). If a party elects to have the other party destroy such information, such party shall provide a certificate to the other certifying that such information has been destroyed and agrees it will not be used.</li>
	<li>The RTS Customer list may be modified by RTS at any time and for any reason without prior notice to Provider.</li>
	<li>Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns from and against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, actions, judgments, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in connection with any third party claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or resulting from (i) a breach of any representation, warranty or obligation set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) the acts or omissions of such party’s employees or agents.</li>
	<li>This Agreement may not be assigned by the parties without the other parties prior written consent.</li>
	<li>This Agreement is and shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant to the laws of the State of Kansas and shall in all respects be governed, construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of such state without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.</li>
	<li>RTS and Provider hereby consent to utilize binding arbitration for all claims or controversies arising under this Agreement for which a federal or state court or other dispute-resolving body would otherwise be authorized to grant relief. By signing this Agreement the parties voluntarily and knowingly waive any right they may otherwise have to seek remedies in court or other forums, including the right to a jury trial. The purpose and effect of utilizing binding arbitration is to substitute arbitration as the forum for resolving all disputes between the parties relating to this Agreement. A single neutral arbitrator engaged in the practice of law shall be mutually agreed upon to conduct the arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date of filing by the party claiming to be aggrieved. The parties agree that any hearings, meetings, or conferences relating the dispute shall take place at a mutually agreed upon location in Kansas City, Kansas, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The parties to this Agreement are prohibited from arbitrating claims subject to this Agreement as, or on behalf of, a class. The parties are also prohibited from consolidating claims subject to this Agreement with claims of any other individual or entity, or of joining the claims of any other individual or entity, except upon the express written agreement of all parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and will be the exclusive remedy for all claims under this Agreement. The final award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party may be represented by an attorney at their own cost and expense. The prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and neither party, nor the arbitrator, may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.</li>
	<li>The relationship of the parties shall be that of independent contractors and neither party shall have authority to bind the other party in any manner.</li>
