89,0,Blog Posts,The Factoring Difference: Two Clients Share Their Stories,The Factoring Difference: Two Clients Share Their Stories,"<p><em>Two longtime RTS Financial clients recently talked with us about how their companies have benefited from factoring. These are their stories:</em></p>
<h2>Kevin M. - Missouri Trucking Company</h2>
<p>Trucking dispatcher Kevin M. started his over-the-road company 13 years ago in western Missouri. He began with four trucks and quickly realized he needed more cash flow to keep up with customer demand. He needed factoring to help his company grow. “Factoring gave my company growth capital that it didn’t have,” he said. Kevin chose RTS Financial as his factor because the advance rates were competitive and he liked that the company was based in nearby Lenexa, Kansas. He soon learned there were other advantages to factoring beyond steady cash flow. Having a third-party company as his collections partner meant one less full-time employee Kevin needed to hire. RTS Financial kept close track of his customers’ payment patterns and would alert him if something looked unusual. “RTS Financial would call me and say, ‘Kevin, this guy you are hauling loads for is not paying you. He’s giving us the run-around.’ That made a big difference in helping us avoid payment defaults,” he said. Kevin also valued RTS Financial’s credit rating system with data on more than 50,000 brokers and shippers. He frequently uses it to assess his new and existing customers. “Most freight brokers are aware of RTS Financial’s rating network and most of them know it’s a tough grade,” he said. “But in my opinion, it has really helped me evaluate my customers.” Kevin’s trucking business has grown to more than 80 employees. Last year, he and a business partner started an intermodal transportation company that is rapidly growing. The two companies combined operate 65 trucks primarily in the Midwest and West. Factoring with a trusted, long-term partner has been key to the expansion of Kevin’s trucking and intermodal businesses. “There’s no way we could have done it without factoring,” he said. “We would be running 15 or 20 trucks today without it.”</p>
<h2>Kaspar - California Trucking Company</h2>
<p>Kaspar is an accounting manager for a trucking company in California that specializes in dry goods hauling in the 48 mainland states. Since opening its doors in 2007, the company has been an RTS Financial client. Factoring provides same-day payment on receivables, so Kaspar’s trucking company does not rely on waiting 30 to 60 days for customer payments. The advances help in terms of running the business and meeting payroll. Another valuable resource for Kaspar’s company is having RTS Financial collect from customers. “Otherwise, we would have to hire more employees to do the accounts receivable and accounts payable functions,” he said. Kaspar’s company recently explored taking on those functions in-house and hiring at least one more employee to handle collections. Ultimately, the company’s owners decided it was better to stick with the competitive advance rates, credit analysis, and back office services of a factoring company. Kaspar said the customer service at RTS Financial has been a key reason his company has remained a client for more than seven years. “We love the availability,” he said. “We can’t afford to wait several days for a company’s credit to be evaluated. With RTS Financial, that evaluation happens almost instantly.”</p>

94,0,Blog Posts,"Strengths and Weaknesses of the $75,000 Bond","Strengths and Weaknesses of the $75,000 Bond","<p>A new federal law that requires freight brokers to post $75,000 surety bonds went into effect in late 2013. The law’s purpose is to weed out corruption in the freight brokerage industry. It also provides more financial protection for carriers victimized by brokers who do not pay them.</p>
<p>The $75,000 bond requirement discouraged at least 10% of the nation’s freight brokers from renewing their licenses for 2014. However, the new law is not expected to remove all unscrupulous brokers from the business. Trucking companies must take precautions to ensure they are protected when working with new brokers.</p>
<h2>Weeding Out Bad Brokers</h2>
<p>In 2012, President Obama signed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) highway funding bill. One of the bill’s biggest measures was to increase the surety bond that freight brokers must post to renew their licenses from $10,000 to $75,000. The bond serves as a guarantee that a carrier will be paid for a load that it delivers for a broker.</p>
<p>Advocates hailed the new bond requirement as a key step in cleaning up freight brokering. While third-party-logistics is a $160 billion business, the industry still has small brokers and freight forwarders who pay their carriers late or not at all. The $10,000 bond made it easy for a broker to set up shop. It was also not much of an incentive for trucking companies to file claims on unpaid shipments. Beefing up the bond requirement to $75,000 gives trucking companies a better chance of collecting part of what they are owed from a bad or out-of-business broker.</p>
<h2>Carriers must be Careful</h2>
<p>While MAP-21 has strengthened the bond requirement, there are still brokers out there that are bad credit risks. Here are five steps your trucking company can take to reduce the risk of working with an unreliable broker:</p>
<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Three things you need to know before working with any broker: Do they have the $75,000 bond, how long have they been in business, and how are they going to pay you? You should also request two or three business references and ask if the brokerage provides other services. For example, many brokers also run their own trucking companies.</p>
<p><strong>Check the broker’s history.</strong> A quick Internet search should reveal the broker’s MC number, DOT number and other information. From this you can find out how long the brokerage has had an active authority, its insurance carrier and other useful information. Much of this information can be found on the <a href=""http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov"">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s website</a>.</p>
<p>You can also check the broker’s credit rating and days-to-pay information with a third-party resource. <a href=""http://www.rtscredit.com"">RTS Credit Service</a>, an affiliate of RTS Financial, monitors payment and credit information on more than 50,000 brokers and carriers.</p>
<p><strong>Negotiate payment terms.</strong> Explore your payment options with the broker and insist on reasonable terms. Many reputable brokers pay within seven days and also offer Quick Pay for a small (usually 1.5%) fee. You can also require the broker to send payments to you once they have been paid by the shipper. Avoid payment terms that allow the broker 30 or more days to pay you for a delivered load.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to your gut.</strong> Pay close attention to the way a brokerage conducts business. How do the brokers answer the phone? Are they professional and easy to reach? Does the brokerage have a website, and what does it look like? An experienced freight brokerage cares about maintaining its outward appearance and building relationships. It does business differently from, say, a trucking dispatcher who is brokering loads on the side.</p>
<p><strong>Watch your credit.</strong> When a brokerage goes belly-up, the $75,000 bond is distributed pro-rata among the claimants. In this situation your trucking company is guaranteed only partial payment of what it is owed. You can guard against lost revenue by diversifying the number of brokers that work with your company. You can also establish limits on the amount of credit you will extend to each broker.</p>

96,0,Blog Posts,How to Negotiate an Oilfield Services MSA,How to Negotiate an Oilfield Services MSA,"<p>A good master service agreement (MSA) will save time and headaches on a complex project. In the oil and gas industry, the MSA sets contractual terms among the companies involved in exploration, drilling, production and service. The agreement outlines the risks and responsibilities among contractors and employees through the life of a project. This eliminates renegotiation and disputes as project work changes.</p>
<p>The MSA also spells out your company’s liability if an accident occurs. In the fast-paced world of oilfield services, it is tempting to take on new business with a handshake. However it is in the best interest of your company and the oilfield operator to have a signed MSA on file. The alternative could be a lawsuit for millions of dollars and financial ruin.</p>
<p>An oil and gas MSA can be an overwhelming document with several difference clauses. Here are six important tips to help ensure that your business interests are protected in the agreement:</p>
<h2>The MSA is not a work order</h2>
<p>The agreement establishes how business will be conducted on the work site but it does not address specific jobs. Key areas that are covered in an MSA include warranties, payment terms, liability insurance and risk management. Many MSAs establish the length of the contract, dispute resolution and termination. The agreement may also dictate business practices like inspections, worksite clean-up and maintenance of payment records.</p>
<p>The MSA says nothing about how many hours your company will work or how much revenue you will generate. Your work orders contain specific information about the cost, location and work done on a particular job. If any information in the work order conflicts with the MSA terms, the MSA takes precedence.</p>
<h2>Does the agreement cover all of your services?</h2>
<p>Make sure the MSA’s language about your company accurately describes all of the work you could potentially do for the project. For example, your company might do welding on a worksite and see the work expand to swabbing or equipment leasing. An MSA that does not include those other services could create liability for your company. Negotiate an agreement that focuses on all of your company’s services, not just the ones that are needed right now.</p>
<h2>Who is held harmless?</h2>
<p>The MSA determines who is responsible in the event of injury to a worker or damage to equipment. Many MSAs include indemnity or “held harmless” provisions in which the operator and contractors are liable for what happens to their own employees. All parties agree not to take legal action against each other if there is an injury or accident on the worksite. This clause is also known as reciprocal indemnity or a “knock-for-knock” provision.</p>
<p>Indemnity is crucial for drilling and other oilfield projects where the risk of injury can be relatively high. Many indemnity clauses also address pollution and environmental damage in light of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Before accepting responsibility for what happens to your workers and equipment, assess the risk of your role in the project. Make sure your company has the right amount of liability insurance to cover that risk. Some MSAs even require contractors to show certificates of insurance to prove that they are covered.</p>
<p>Finally, familiarize yourself with state law. Different states have various laws on the books about knock-for-knock provisions. States like Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico have “anti-indemnity” statutes. These laws are meant to protect smaller contractors from an operator’s negligence. Make sure you understand your company’s legal rights in the state where you operate.</p>
<h2>Watch for harmful restrictions</h2>
<p>In some instances, the MSA may include payment terms and restrictions that conflict with work orders and other contracts. This may come back to haunt you since the MSA acts as a blanket contract over other agreements. Make sure the MSA does not include language that could limit your company’s ability to do work and make money on the project.</p>
<h2>How can the agreement be terminated?</h2>
<p>Most MSAs include a termination clause. This spells out what is expected from all parties and what is considered breach of contract. Make sure the language does not set your company up for failure. Watch out for clauses that call for automatic termination for work not performed in a certain time frame. You do not want the termination clause to be too specific or demanding.</p>
<h2>Do not sign anything you do not understand</h2>
<p>If your company has never negotiated an MSA before, you should have a lawyer look at the agreement. Even if you are familiar with MSAs, you may come across one with terms that are difficult to understand. Consult an expert to help negotiate a beneficial agreement that protects your company’s interests.</p>

99,0,Blog Posts,How Leasing Equipment Can Help Grow Your Oilfield Services Business ,How Leasing Equipment Can Help Grow Your Oilfield Services Business ,"<p>The oil drilling business is booming nationwide. Whether your company operates in Texas or the Bakken Basin, you may be scrambling to add new equipment that meets rising customer demand.</p>
<p>Fracturing equipment, acid pumps, kill trucks, batch mixers and other assets can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That is why many oilfield services companies choose to lease their equipment. Avoiding the big down payments and interest that come with traditional lending can free up more cash flow for your company to operate and expand.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why leasing can be better than buying equipment for your oilfield services company:</p>
<h2>Less expense and more capital</h2>
<p>The greatest benefit of leasing is you can save cash and apply it to other parts of your business. There is usually no down payment with leasing. An open-end lease offers the most flexibility in operating equipment. It allows you to treat lease payments as an expense on your income statement. This kind of lease provides significant tax benefits without the lease obligation affecting your balance sheet. You can treat the lease payments as monthly operating expenses and deduct them from your company’s tax return.</p>
<p>Leasing equipment spares you the time and energy of seeking a line of credit to finance a purchase. You may also be able to afford more expensive equipment by leasing instead of buying it.</p>
<p>Most lease agreements offer fixed terms for a period of 24, 36, 48 or 60 months. Unlike traditional financing, you do not need to pay more each month to reduce your company’s interest. That makes it easier for your company to plan its operating budget around a lease payment.</p>
<h2>Less risk and more flexibility</h2>
<p>As much as 85% of small- to mid-sized businesses lease equipment, according to GE Capital. These companies realize that they can be more profitable by operating machinery instead of owning it. Leasing also provides greater flexibility in case of an unforeseen expense or an economic downturn.</p>
<p>For your oilfield services company, short-term leases allow you to expand and reduce the amount of equipment your company operates as the market changes. Leasing also helps you determine if new equipment or technology is a good fit for your company before you invest in a long-term commitment.</p>
<p>There are many types of lease agreements that allow you to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. A fair market value lease provides several flexible options. Once the term expires, you can return the equipment to the lessor, renew the terms, or buy the equipment at its fair market value. Another common lease is the “dollar buyout,” which guarantees the option of buying equipment for $1 at the end of the lease agreement.</p>
<h2>Fewer maintenance headaches</h2>
<p>One of the drawbacks of owning equipment is that you are responsible for its upkeep. Breakdowns can lead to unexpected expenses and interruptions to your business. If you have a full-service lease agreement, the leasing company is responsible for the maintenance.</p>
<h2>An easy exit plan</h2>
<p>Equipment depreciates in value as it ages and takes on wear-and-tear. When you own assets that you no longer need, you have to figure out how to sell them. You will likely have to sell them at a much lower price than what you paid to acquire them. Negotiating a competitive lease rate up-front on equipment eases the worry of depreciation. It also spares you the time and effort of finding a buyer later on.</p>

102,0,Blog Posts,Equity Crowdfunding: A New Way to Raise Capital,Equity Crowdfunding: A New Way to Raise Capital,"<p>Until recently, crowdfunding was seen as an effective way to request donations on the Internet. A filmmaker might launch a campaign on Kickstarter.com to raise money for a documentary. A volunteer could use Facebook to solicit donations for a nonprofit. People who gave to a crowdfunding campaign might be compensated with free products, souvenir T-shirts or movie tickets.</p>
<p>Today, companies are starting to use crowdfunding as a form of alternative financing. Equity crowdfunding emerged last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission loosened rules governing how businesses can seek investments. New rules under the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act now allow companies to advertise for “accredited” investors. The SEC defines these investors as individuals who make more than $200,000 a year or households that have a net worth of more than $1 million.</p>
<p>in many states, even novice investors are able to buy stakes in companies through crowdfunding. The SEC is expected to open up equity crowdfunding to “mom and pop” investors nationwide, with no limitations on their wealth. That could happen as soon as 2016, the SEC has estimated. In the meantime, 24 states have passed legislation that opens up equity crowdfunding to non-accredited investors. Colorado, for example, recently approved a law that allows businesses to raise as much as $1 million through equity crowdfunding. Non-accredited investors in Colorado are limited to individual investments of $5,000 under the new law, which takes effect in August 2016.   </p>
<p>The move toward regular investors may revolutionize how companies raise money. Currently, equity crowdfunding is mostly used by tech start-ups. However, real estate firms, restaurants and other businesses have recently gotten into the game. In 2014, the Hard Rock Hotel in Palm Springs, Calif., announced it raised more than $1.5 million through two months of equity crowdfunding. In Kansas, which was the first state in the country to pass an equity crowdfunding law, residents in the small town of Minneola used crowdfunding to invest in and open a new grocery store.  </p>
<p>Your company may not be a Silicon Valley start-up or a destination resort. Still, equity crowdfunding could soon be an effective form of alternative financing that helps traditional companies raise cash. Private capital is estimated to be a $2 trillion industry. Billions of those dollars are expected to be invested through online crowdfunding in the coming years. An estimated $204 million was raised through equity crowdfunding in 2013. The World Bank has predicted that total crowdfunding, which includes donations, equity and credit, will be a $93 billion industry by 2025.</p>
<p>The number of crowdfunding platforms has increased from a handful to more than 1,000 in recent years. Below are seven web-based companies that specialize in matching businesses with equity crowdfunding. Most of these companies work with a range of traditional industries and will expand their reach as crowdfunding continues to grow:</p>

105,0,Blog Posts,How to Run a Business from Your Mobile Device,How to Run a Business from Your Mobile Device,"<p>Today’s mobile technology means you no longer have to be at your desk or laptop to conduct business.</p>
<p>Cloud-based software allows you to store important data that you can access anywhere at any time. Instead of lugging around a 5-pound laptop, you can do business from your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>What exactly do you need to operate your company from the beach, a hotel lobby or a favorite coffee shop? There are hundreds of apps to choose from that can help you do business from your mobile device. All of these products gain access to your company’s information through the “cloud,” which may seem scary. However, cloud-based technology is now as secure as computer-based software. With the cloud, you also do not have to worry about losing data if your PC crashes or you lose a thumb drive. <img src=""https://www.rtsfinancial.com/sites/default/files/mobile-business.jpg"" style=""width: 650px;"" /></p>
<p>Choosing the right cloud-based apps to help manage different areas of your business can be overwhelming. What follows is a directory of industry-leading applications that address a range of business functions:</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 2.4em;"">Finance and Accounting</h2>
<h3>Quickbooks</h3>
<p>Intuit-owned<a href=""http://www.quickbooks.com"">QuickBooks</a> is the U.S. market leader in accounting software. The cloud-based version of QuickBooks was redesigned last year to make it easier to use on a smartphone or tablet. QuickBooks can sync your finances and account information across all your devices, including the iPad, iPhone and Android. The app provides real-time payables, receivables and cash flow, and prepares your data for tax time. The QuickBooks dashboard’s color-coded approach makes it easy to track open invoices, overdue bills and your overall cash balance. QuickBooks also allows you to personalize and send your invoices from anywhere at any time, and it deposits money into your bank account when you get paid.</p>
<p>With QuickBooks, you can expand your mobile reach through integration with other Intuit products, as well as more than 90 third-party business apps.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> QuickBooks allows a free, month-long trial period to try the software. Subscriptions start at $12.95 per month.

Unlike QuickBooks, Xero was developed with mobile devices in mind. The Xero Touch application works with the iPhone, iPad and Android. Xero offers real-time tracking of accounting transactions and customizable invoices that customers can pay digitally. The software’s account reconciling feature is easy to use and allows you to perform what was once a time-consuming task within minutes.

<p>One of the advantages of <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com"">FreshBooks</a> presents is that it can show exactly when a client has viewed your digital invoice. This capability eliminates the common customer excuse about “not receiving the invoice.” Like other online accounting software, FreshBooks allows you to customize invoices and lets your customers pay digitally.

FreshBooks is available on iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> FreshBooks offers a free, 30-day trial period. Pricing starts at $12.95 per month with a package that accommodates as many as five customers and unlimited invoices.</p>

106,106,Blog Posts,Best Practices for Working with Load Boards and Freight Brokers ,Best Practices for Working with Load Boards and Freight Brokers ,"<p>Profitable loads are the lifeblood of your trucking company. To consistently book loads with the best margins, it helps to have connections. You must build a network of trusted industry sources instead of relying on one client or broker for most of your business.</p>

<p>Here are seven tips that will give your company an edge in securing quality loads:</p> 

<p><strong>Work directly with shippers.</strong> Having your own shipping clients can help you command better rates. It eliminates the middle man because you are not working through a broker or load board. Having clients you trust and who pay promptly can also reduce paperwork and administrative hurdles. Some carriers recommend that at least half of your loads should come from direct customers.</p> 

<p><strong>Shop around for online load boards.</strong> There are hundreds of load boards on the Internet. Some load boards are free, but most charge a monthly subscription. The largest, most established boards include <a href=""http://dat.com"">DAT</a>, <a href=""http://www.truckstop.com"">Internet Truckstop</a> and <a href=""http://www.getloaded.com"">GetLoaded.com</a>. Do some research and find the board that has the most loads and the best rates in the lanes you serve. Using more than one load board is optimal in terms of finding the best loads at the best prices.</p> 

<p><strong>Know your bottom dollar rate.</strong> A good business owner tracks his company’s finances and knows its break-even point at any given time. Before calling on loads, have a per-mile rate in mind that ensures your company will at least break even on the haul. Having this knowledge up-front can save you valuable time in selecting loads and negotiating rates.</p> 

<p><strong>Be patient and persistent.</strong> Finding a load that pays an acceptable rate and fits your schedule is not easy. Sometimes the search can take several hours and dozens of phone calls. Be selective and do not settle for low rates or loads that are in lanes you do not want to drive. Be professional but firm in your negotiations with brokers and shippers.  Do not be afraid to walk away from a load that does not benefit your business.</p>  

<p><strong>Find brokers you trust.</strong> As with load boards, there are many freight brokers or third-party logistics providers (3PLs) to choose from. Be careful when selecting a broker. Some withhold shipper payments from their drivers for months while addressing other costs. Other brokers are “glorified telemarketers,” lacking knowledge about the trucking business. However, reputable brokers and 3PLs want to work with reliable carriers and can be a valuable source for finding quality loads. Before working with a broker, check his or her online ratings and ask for personal references.</p>  

<p><strong>Minimize your deadhead miles.</strong> Before taking on a load that pays, say, $2.30 or more per mile, calculate what the return trip will cost you.  Are you willing to take on deadhead miles or is there a return shipment available that will make the trip more profitable? This is an instance when having a network of shippers, load boards and brokers can benefit your trucking business.</p> 

<p><strong>Take advantage of the driver shortage.</strong> There has been a national shortage of commercial drivers and trucks for years. An improving economy is squeezing the market more than ever before. Average rates per-mile for all modes of trucking continue to climb and shippers expect the market to remain tight in 2015. That means there should be quality loads at competitive rates for trucking fleets of all sizes. By shopping among multiple sources, you can book business that will help your company thrive in a carrier-friendly marketplace.</p>

<h2>Sure-Fire Ways to Use Online Load Boards</h2>

<p>There are many trucking load boards on the Internet. Here are a few tips on how to choose the right ones for your company:</p>

<p><strong>Use more than one board.</strong> No single load board has all the information a trucking company needs. Signing up on a handful of good boards increases your chances of getting the best loads.</p> 

<p><strong>Watch your spending.</strong> Some load boards are free, but most charge a subscription fee. You should not pay more than $30 per month for access to a load board.</p>  

<p><strong>Post a company profile.</strong> This is the best way for shippers who are visiting load boards to find your company. You can lure them in with information about your fleet size, home base, types of freight you haul and how far you want to drive.</p> 

<p><strong>Seek out the best loads.</strong> Do not settle for the first loads you see on a board. Advanced searches on multiple boards will help you find the most profitable loads.</p> 

<p><strong>Be patient.</strong> Loads are not always accurately advertised on a board. Sometimes boards are slow to remove loads that are no longer available. Anticipate running into a few dead ends when seeking a quality load. It may take you a few hours and many phone calls.</p> 

<p><strong>Avoid over-booking.</strong> Do not take on more work than your company can handle. Pay close attention to the size of the load and distance of the haul.</p> 

<p><strong>Build your reputation.</strong> Picking up and delivering loads on time will help your company stand out from among thousands of truckers patrolling the boards. If you build a reputation for strong reliability, shippers will soon seek you out.</p> 

<p><strong>Protect your privacy.</strong> You want to be guarded about the amount of information you share. Do not give out any personal or company information you do not want to be shared publicly on the Internet.</p>

107,0,Blog Posts,The Benefits of Backhauls and Re-Loads,The Benefits of Backhauls and Re-Loads,"<p>A few years ago, trucking companies would regularly deadhead their trucks 100 or more miles to get to their next load. Today experts say that average has been reduced to around 60 miles. Fuel costs and other expenses make deadheading a losing proposition for trucking companies.</p>
<p>One solution to deadheading is backhauling. A backhaul is freight carried on a return trip back to or near your home base. In most cases, you will use a different shipper on the backhaul than you did for the outbound freight. For example, your driver may haul a load for a furniture client from Des Moines to a Walmart store in Olathe, Kan. He then drives to nearly Lenexa, Kan., to pick up a load of appliances from another shipper. The driver backhauls that load to your home base of Des Moines. <img src=""https://www.rtsfinancial.com/sites/default/files/southestern-us-backhaul.png"" style=""float: right; padding: 0 0 30px 30px; margin-top: 70px; width: 360px;"" /></p>
<h2>The Re-Load</h2>
<p>In some cases, you may be able to use the same shipping customer for the outbound load as well as a return trip. This is called a “round-trip load” or a “re-load.” Here is a fictional example of how that kind of arrangement works:</p>
<p>As the accompanying map illustrates, your company has just hauled a full truckload of furniture 550 miles from St. Louis (“1”) to ABC Distributors in Atlanta (“2”). Before the shipment arrives, you send a courtesy email to ABC asking if they have any loads that your company can haul on the way back to your home base of St. Louis. You tell them you are willing to haul a load at a discount in order to avoid returning home with an empty trailer. Your contact at ABC informs you that the company does need to move a load of carpets from Atlanta to Louisville, Ky. (“3”). You accept the load because it means that you will be paid for 420 of the 680 miles returning from Atlanta to St. Louis.</p>
<h2>Cutting Down on Deadhead Miles</h2>
<p>Backhauls do not have to be direct trips back to your headquarters. They can involve getting to other lanes you want to use. For example, your company moves a load from Cleveland (""4"") to Miami (""5"") for $2.30 per mile. The backhaul you are able to get from Miami only pays $1.10 a mile – just enough to cover your operating expenses. However, that backhaul gets your truck to Charlotte, where you have another load waiting that will pay your company $2.00 a mile. Even though your backhaul from Miami to Charlotte was at a greatly reduced rate, it is preferable to the empty miles of deadheading.</p>

How you process invoices and how soon customers pay them determines how smoothly you convert services into cash, and how fast your business will grow.</p>

<p>The following is a fictional example of what happens to one invoice when a company does everything right. It illustrates how tactics like managing a cash flow budget, negotiating payment terms and handling collections can effectively turn a receivable into a customer payment. In short, this illustrates how a cash conversion cycle should work:</p>

<h3>Step 1 - New Business</h3>

<p>ABC Manufacturing Corp. needs your company to build and ship 10,000 widgets and will pay $20,000 for the work. </p>

<h3>Step 2 - Calculating Cost</h3>

<p>This is a big order for your business. You calculate it will cost your company $15,000 to make and transport the widgets, as well as pay your staff overtime to complete the work.  The project should net your company a $5,000 profit. </p>

<h3>Step 3 - Checking Cash Flow</h3>

<p>Before committing to ABC Manufacturing, you consult your cash flow budget to make sure you have enough money on hand to do the work. You have $45,000 in cash, which should cover the job as well as fund your company during the period while you await payment. </p>

<h3>Step 4 - Knowing the Customer</h3>

<p>After checking ABC Manufacturer’s credit information, you see the company has a history of paying two weeks late. You need to receive $20,000 from the company within 30 days or your cash flow will take a hit. You successfully negotiate a 15-day payment term with your new client. </p>

<h3>Step 5 - Finishing the Job</h3>

<p>You produce the widgets and deliver them on time. The cost comes in below budget at $14,500. </p>

<h3>Step 6 - Invoicing</h3>

<p>You send your $20,000 invoice to ABC Manufacturing the same day the widgets arrive at their warehouse.</p>

<h3>Step 7 - Emails and Phone Calls</h3>

<p>As expected, 15 days pass with no payment from your client. On the 15th day, you send an e-mail reminding ABC Manufacturing of the unpaid invoice. You follow up with a phone call three days later.</p>

<h3>Step 8 - Payment</h3>

<p>Payment arrives from ABC Manufacturing 20 days after the widgets were delivered. Congratulations! You were able to shave 10 days from the traditional 30-day payment period. You can put that money to work on growing your company right away.</p>

115,0,Blog Posts,How to Write a Business Plan for Your Trucking Company,How to Write a Business Plan for Your Trucking Company,"<p>Do you have a plan for growing your trucking company? If so, you need to put that plan on paper.</p>

<p>A business plan is the most effective way to explain the stability and goals of your company. Banks, investors and other potential partners may ask to see your business plan. Having a well-crafted document to share makes a strong statement about your company.</p>

<p>The process of writing your business plan also has value.  It can help you better understand your industry and your own company. Writing a business plan allows you to step back from day-to-day operations and see the big picture.  What are your company’s strengths in the marketplace? How is your company different from competitors? Where do you want your company to be in five years? How will you achieve that growth? Having a business plan and updating it at least once a year can help your company identify and achieve its goals.</p>

<p>Every business plan is unique, but there is a formula you can follow. There are also several software products available that walk you through creating a business plan and a financial forecast. Cloud-based <a href=""http://www.liveplan.com"">software like LivePan</a> costs as little as $11.66 per month and can help you craft a business plan within a few hours.  You can also view sample business plans on the Internet, including this gallery of <a href=""http://www.bplans.com/sample_business_plans.php"">500 example plans across multiple industries</a>.</p>  

<p>Below are key sections to include when writing a simple business plan for your trucking company.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>This section appears first, but you will want to write it after thinking through the other parts of your business plan. The executive summary is a one- to two-page overview that introduces your company and its future plans. It also explains why your company will succeed in meeting its goals.</p>
  
<p>The executive summary needs to be quick, accurate and filled with good information. If the reader does not find it compelling, he or she will not read the rest of your business plan. The executive summary should highlight the following: your company mission, products and services, performance highlights, financial information and future plans.</p> 

<h2>Company Description</h2>

<p>This section details the history and background of your business. It describes the overall mission of your company and what makes it unique from its competitors. The company description contains key facts about your trucking company: the owners, the year it was incorporated, where you conduct business and the states where the company is registered. If you have several employees, this is where you can outline your organizational structure, as well as roles and responsibilities.</p> 

<p>Use this section to promote your company’s competitive advantages. You can write about newly acquired clients, fleet expansions and other recent successes.</p> 

<h2>Services</h2>

<p>Outline the trucking services your company provides and how you are meeting customer needs. For example, a trucking company in Atlanta might explain that it hauls flatbed loads because the southeast has a longer construction season and a large timber industry. Including the customer perspective builds the case that your services are important and in demand.</p> 

<p>The services section can also include details about pricing, the materials you haul and the industries that you serve.</p> 

<h2>Market Analysis</h2>

<p>Your market analysis illustrates how well you know your business. It shows your awareness of industry trends, customer needs and how your company plans to capitalize on them.</p> 

<p>It is beneficial to provide a broad range of data that explains why your company can excel in a crowded trucking market. The U.S. Small Business Administration suggests these topics should make up your market analysis:</p>

<p><strong>Industry Description and Outlook</strong> – How big is your segment of the trucking industry? Who are the major carriers and the biggest shippers?</p>

<p><strong>Your Target Market</strong> – What is your company’s sweet spot? Many companies try to specialize in too many markets. Your company can stand out by narrowing its focus to target markets that generate the greatest returns.</p> 

<p><strong>Distinguishing Characteristics</strong> – Explain the critical needs of potential customers and how your company will meet them.</p>

<p><strong>Size of the Primary Target Market</strong> – Provide more detail about your most important market and customers.</p> 

<p><strong>Market Share</strong> – How much business does your company expect to gain within a specific time period? Explain your logic behind these projections.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing and Gross Margin Targets</strong> – Define your company’s pricing structure, margins and any possible discounts.</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong> – Show that you have done your homework on your competitors. Describe their strengths and weaknesses.</p> 

<p><strong>Regulatory Restrictions</strong> –  How have government regulations like Hours of Service and fuel emissions guidelines affected your company? How do you expect future restrictions to have an impact?</p> 

<h2>Sales and Marketing</h2>
<p>Now that you have analyzed your market, what is your strategy to gain market share? This section can be split into two categories:</p> 

<p><strong>Marketing Strategy</strong> – Explain your tactics for building a loyal customer base and attracting new customers. How will you promote your services and what channels will you use to do it (examples: trade publications, social media and email lists)? Does your strategy include acquisitions or major purchases? What industries and regions will you target in promoting your company?</p>  

<p><strong>Sales Strategy</strong> – Describe the vision for your sales force. Do you plan on adding sales associates or using independent agents? How do you identify prospects and what is your process for calling on them? Explain the closing rate of your sales team and how that contributes to your company’s financial goals.</p> 

<h2>Financial Projections</h2>

<p>This section contains financial statements and information that show your company’s ability to meet its goals. Include basic statements like profit & loss, cash flow, your company balance sheet and your sales forecast. You will also need to paint a picture of how your company will perform over the next five years. Make sure that your projections line up with any financing requests you plan to make to help grow your business.</p> 

<p>Your business plan does not have to follow this exact structure. Business plans can differ significantly by industry. You can find thousands of examples of actual plans on the Internet. However, your business plan must be unique to your company and its goals. Writing one may be a lengthy process, but it can help steer your company in a positive direction.</p>

116,0,Blog Posts,"Eight Ways to Survive the Oil Bust, and Prepare for the Next Boom","Eight Ways to Survive the Oil Bust, and Prepare for the Next Boom","<p>From North Dakota’s Bakken to the Permian Basin in West Texas, times are tough for the oil business.</p>
<p>After more than four years of explosive growth, plummeting oil prices put the brakes on shale drilling in 2015. At the end of the year, the number of oil rigs operating in North Dakota dropped to 62, which is 71% fewer than the number of active rigs at the same time in 2014. Nationwide, the number of inland oil rigs totalled 684 at the end of December 2015, a 62% decline from 2014. </p>
<p>Oil exploration companies and their vendors have cut thousands of oilfield services jobs. More rigs will be shut down and more jobs will be lost in the coming months. Experts predict oil prices will remain around $40 per barrel for the next several months.</p>
<p>Your company may have felt the effects of this downturn in the oil market. You might even wonder how your business will survive if drilling does not rebound quickly. Below are eight steps you can take to protect your company from the decline. Adopting most of these measures can also position your company for better, sustainable growth when oil prices rise again.</p>
<p>Oil, as they say, is a boom or bust business. These steps will help you make the best of both ends of that cycle:</p>
<h2>Devise a Backup Plan</h2>
<p>Veteran drillers who lived through a few cycles in the oil business know that the good times do not last forever. To protect your company and your employees, you need a Plan B that you can put into action during the lean times. What kind of work can your people and equipment perform when the oil rigs are shut down?</p>
<p>If you operate a fleet hauling sand or water for the rigs, one solution is to shift your resources to different trucking modes. The trucking market is tight, with shippers moving more freight tonnage and a national shortage of 48,000 drivers. Those market conditions translate into very favorable load rates for truckload and less-than-truckload carriers. You may need to spend some money on new equipment for your fleets. However, serving other trucking modes can create a new revenue stream for your company while putting your drivers and power units back to work.</p>
<h2>Analyze Your Cash Flow</h2>
<p>You need to know how much money moves through your company and if that cash flow is going to be enough to sustain it. Do you have any money left over after paying your bills and one-time expenses? If your company is not yet profitable, know your break-even point. Your company is breaking even when revenue equals all of your fixed and variable costs. You need to determine a profit margin that funds your company while also allowing you to put some money away to get through the lean times. For more information about financial statements and cash flow, read our guide, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/trucking-calculations-formulas"">Financial Management for Trucking Companies</a>.</p>
<h2>Set Realistic Revenue Goals</h2>
<p>One mistake some business owners made during the oil boom was trying to grow too fast. Today, some of those businesses are cutting jobs or closing their doors. If your company is still new to oilfield services, study your market and develop some revenue goals that are ambitious but achievable. Have a plan for how you will handle that growth through available cash, headcount and assets. Likewise, plan to have some cash on hand when new business opportunities dry up. Growth is good, but it will initially drain cash and other assets. Be careful when planning your company’s growth.</p>
<h2>Stay Liquid</h2>
<p>When times are good, it is tempting to pump all of your profits into buying new equipment and adding headcount to your company. The smarter play is to put a portion of that money into investments that can be liquidated when your company needs the cash. Work with a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner to build a portfolio of stocks, bonds and mutual funds where your money will grow until you need it. Another approach is to invest some earnings into real estate, though it is not as liquid as the stock market. Volatility in the real estate market might mean you have to cash out when your holdings have lost some of their value.</p>
<h2>Reduce Costs</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to explore areas where you can cut spending without damaging your business. Take a critical eye to fixed costs like office space, payroll, equipment agreements and service providers. Can you lease less-expensive office space? Can you outsource some of your back-office functions to companies that specialize in that work? Even something as simple as switching telecom providers can potentially save your company hundreds of dollars per month.</p>
<p>Consider doing away with anything that is not essential to your business, from the copier you never use to the break room coffee machine. For contracts that are up for renewal, try renegotiating terms that are more favorable. Finally, as an alternative to layoffs, consider implementing a temporary, across-the-board salary reduction. Your employees will appreciate your keeping them on the payroll. That goodwill may pay off for your business when the market improves.</p>
<h2>Know When You Need Financing</h2>
<p>The right time to seek outside funding is before the point when your company desperately needs it. Avoid the mistake that many business owners make by waiting too long to get financing.</p>
<p>Understanding your company’s strengths and weaknesses, your available cash flow and your market are essential. Do you need capital to survive a downturn or to purchase equipment and trucks? Different stages in your company’s life can call for different forms of financing. <a href=""/guides/what-factoring"">Factoring, which is sometimes called ""accounts receivable financing""</a>, may be a good fit because you incur no debt and there are no limits to the amount of funding.</p>
<p>At other times, you may be willing to take on debt to fuel your company’s growth. It is important to plan your debt so that it follows the life of the asset it is financing. For example, taking out a five-year loan for equipment that fully depreciates in three years is a bad financing strategy.</p>
<h2>Manage Risks</h2>
<p>Calculate the benefits of financing for your company (growth, sustainability) against the risks (debt, default). Can your company afford to take on debt? How much should you borrow? Are you comfortable putting property, equipment or even your own home up as collateral? Could your company survive if you default? Explore all your financing options, from alternative lenders to banks, to find the right fit.</p>
<p>Also, take a strategic approach to managing your assets. Does your company really need brand-new acid pumps, kill trucks or other equipment to operate effectively? New equipment often requires big down-payments and interest that can eat up your cash flow. Equipment lease agreements are more flexible and require less capital, <a href=""/articles/how-leasing-equipment-can-help-grow-your-oilfield-services-business"">as this story on leasing illustrates</a>.</p>
<h2>Seek Advice from Reliable Sources</h2>
<p>Building a first-rate company that endures ups and downs in the oil market will require some outside expertise. You need to assemble a team of advisors who know your industry and have more than just a monetary interest in your company’s growth. This team can include bankers, CPAs, financial planners, legal counsel and other lenders like a factoring company.</p>
<p>Not all of your advisors need to come from the legal or financial community. In the close-knit world of oilfield services, you can benefit from friendships with other business owners who are veterans in the industry. Seek out mentors and consider forming an advisory board of entrepreneurs. You will need some outside help in building a business that will last in the challenging oilfield services sector.</p>

141,0,Blog Posts,The Benefits of Hiring a Professional Employer Organization (PEO),The Benefits of Hiring a Professional Employer Organization (PEO),"<p>Few entrepreneurs start their own companies because they love managing human resources. However, many become buried in the details of workforce management as their companies grow.</p>

<p>Small businesses with a headcount of 10 to 100 employees often find themselves in human resources limbo. They lack the time to address HR issues and also lack the resources to create an HR department.</p>

<p>Fortunately, many HR functions can be outsourced for a fraction of the cost of managing them in-house. Many small- to mid-sized companies hand those responsibilities over to professional employer organizations, or “PEOs.” The PEO market has grown rapidly as the Affordable Care Act and other legislation have made human resources more complex and time-intensive than ever before.</p>

<h2>What is a PEO?</h2>

<p>Put simply, a PEO is a third-party provider that can operate as your company’s off-site HR office. Just as an outside law firm might help your company with legal matters, the PEO can manage all HR-related jobs. Those functions include payroll, employee benefits, unemployment insurance taxes and worker’s compensation.  The role of the PEO is to be an expert in all aspect of employing workers.</p>

<p>The PEO industry is only about 30 years old but has grown tremendously in the past decade. In 2012, PEOs generated an estimated $92 billion in revenue and provided services for 2.5 million U.S. workers, according to the <a href=""http://www.napeo.org/"">National Association of Professional Employer Organizations</a>.</p>

<p>Today, the federal government and all U.S. states recognize PEOs’ legal right to serve as an employer or co-employer. In December 2014, Congress passed the Small Business Efficiency Act. The new law authorizes certified PEOs to pay wages to worksite employees, as well as collect and remit payroll taxes.</p> 

<h2>Used in Many Industries</h2>

<p>What kind of a company would co-employ its workers with a PEO? The practice has become common across a wide range of different industries. Almost any kind of business may find value in outsourcing its employment work.  Even companies with as many as 500 employees enlist the help of a PEO.</p> 

<p>Small businesses lacking resources or expertise to perform most HR functions can gain the most from hiring a PEO. A good PEO offers efficiencies, integrated technology and cost savings in managing employees. A PEO also makes sure its clients comply with complex and ever-changing employment laws and regulations. Also, handing over most of the employment responsibilities to a PEO frees company owners to spend more time on running and expanding their business.</p>

<p>A PEO appeals to many companies because it can help save money. Outsourcing employment responsibilities allows a business to maintain a scaled-back in-house HR department, or no department at all. The PEO’s economy of scale also reduces costs related to recruiting and hiring, and software technology for HR functions.</p>  

<h2>Keeping Control</h2>
<p>For some business owners, handing over so much responsibility to an outside firm sounds risky. Can using a PEO to handle payroll, worker’s comp, health care benefits and other functions mean possibly losing control of your company?</p>

<p>The short answer is no. The PEO’s client retains ownership of its company and control over operations. In a typical PEO contract, the PEO and client share employee responsibilities and liabilities as “co-employers.” The company still has control over maintaining its worksite and complying with safety regulations. Because it handles payroll, taxes and maintains employment records, the PEO does reserve a right to hire and fire. Generally, however, the PEO has no control over a client’s business operations.</p>

<h2>A Regulated Business</h2>
<p>There are an estimated 900 PEOs operating in every U.S. state. Most states have laws on the books that govern the licensing, certification and regulation of PEOs. The PEO industry also has its own regulatory body, the Employer Services Assurance Corporation (ESAC). Similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in banking, ESAC has an accreditation program for PEOs and performs regular audits. When seeking a PEO, be sure to select one that is ESAC-accredited. The accreditation carries more than $15 million in surety bonds protecting that PEO’s clients.</p>

We have found that this kind of ongoing dialogue with customers is the best way to make sure we continue to provide the best financial services in the industry. </p>
<p>Below are accounts from three different customers about their experiences with RTS Financial. While these are just three perspectives, their stories are similar to those of hundreds of business owners we work with on a daily basis:</p>
<p>“Everything is on the up-and-up.”</p>
<p>Alex launched his new trucking company in 2014. He wanted to factor right away and learned about RTS Financial from one of our agents. We offered Alex a competitive rate for $200,000 per month. His Chicago fleet began factoring with RTS Financial in October. </p>
<p>An industry veteran, Alex has owned other trucking companies and has worked with other factors. He praised RTS Financial for honoring commitments and for being easy to work with. His company now has 15 trucks hauling freight between Illinois and Texas. Alex’s monthly factoring volume has increased to $300,000.</p>
<p>“Many factoring companies do not follow up on what they say they are going to do for you when you sign an agreement,” he said. “With RTS Financial, we have not had any problems. Transfers are on time, there are no delays. Everything is on the up-and-up.”</p>
<p>In addition to factoring with RTS Financial, Alex’s fleet is a fuel card customer with our affiliate, RTS Carrier Services. He has also referred two trucking companies that have now become RTS Financial clients. </p>
<p>Aggressive Growth with Factoring</p>
<p>Jim began negotiating a factoring agreement with RTS Financial in June 2014. He was about to launch his Georgia-based trucking and logistics company and needed a factor. Jim’s business partner knew about RTS Financial and recommended our services.</p>
<p>Jim’s company began factoring with RTS Financial last August at a volume of $400,000 per month. Since that time, his fleet has grown to more than 50 trucks, and has been profitable since October.</p>
<p>Factoring with RTS Financial has fueled the company’s impressive growth, Jim said. He described his dedicated account representative at RTS Financial as “awesome.” The integrity and reliability of financing and back-office services from RTS Financial has made it easier for Jim and his trucking fleet to get off to a strong start.</p>
<p>“You guys have been the most straight-up and responsible partner that we’ve dealt with so far. I really can’t complain,” he said.   </p>
<p>Overcoming a Low Credit Rating</p>
<p>The flexibility of factoring means that a company does not need to have a stellar credit score to receive financing. When Steve began his Texas trucking company in 2014, he had a credit score of 609 that included a 2010 bankruptcy. However, three of RTS Financial’s other factoring clients vouched for Steve and his fleet. His company began factoring with us in October. </p>
<p>In a short span of time, Steve’s fleet grew to more than 10 trucks and was also approved by RTS Carrier Services for a Fleet One fuel card. The company currently factors at a monthly volume of $120,000. Steve said that he has been impressed with the accessibility and expertise of all of his contacts at RTS Financial and RTS Carrier Services. </p>
<p>“All I have to say is that I am very, very happy and satisfied with the team that I have,” he said. “Great people, great team!”</p>

168,0,Blog Posts,How Factoring Can Help Your Oilfield Services Company ,How Factoring Can Help Your Oilfield Services Company ,"<p>Any roustabout or hotshot driver can tell you that everything moves faster in the boom-or-bust oilfield industry. Everything, it seems, but the payment cycles.</p>
<p>Companies that serve oil rigs in Texas, North Dakota or Pennsylvania must wait as long as 60 to 90 days to receive payments from their customers. That length of time can make it nearly impossible to build up cash flow, especially for start-up trucking fleets hauling water or sand to well sites.</p>
<p>The best way to generate working capital in the oilfield services industry is through factoring. Also called “accounts receivable financing,” factoring turns your invoices into cash in 24 hours or less. That quickly generates the working capital needed to catch up on bills, pay owner-operators, and buy any equipment necessary to keep up with the next oil and gas boom. Oilfield pros who operate their companies without financing can take years just to build up a fleet of four or five trucks. Companies that use factoring as a way to increase cash flow can expand operations at a much quicker pace.</p>
<p>Below are the key ways that factoring can help you maintain and grow a successful oilfield services company. To learn even more, download <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-factoring"">Your Complete Guide to Factoring</a> on the RTS Financial website.</p>
<h2>Fast Payments</h2>
<p>Factoring allows your company to receive payment for its services almost immediately. A factoring company buys your invoices, then advances cash on those invoices in less than a day. Some factors advance as much as 90% of an invoice’s value, then pay the balance due once your customer pays them. The factor withholds a small fee for assuming the collections risk.</p>
<p>Some companies choose to generate cash through Quick Pay financing. However, payments through Quick Pay can take three to seven days to process. Factoring takes less than 24 hours. The fees for Quick Pay tend to be higher and not all freight brokers offer a Quick Pay solution. Relying only on Quick Pay to finance your receivables could limit the number of brokers your company can work with.</p>
<h2>Easy Set-Up</h2>
<p>It can take weeks or even months of paperwork to get approved for a line of credit from a bank or other traditional lenders. With most factors, your oilfield company can set up an account and start funding receivables in less than a week. One advantage of factoring is that even companies that are new or have a low credit score can qualify for financing. Your factoring provider will be more concerned about your customers’ credit and payment histories. Another benefit of factoring is that it is not a loan. Your company does not assume any debt when it factors.</p>
<h2>Smart Technology</h2>
<p>When selecting a factoring company, it is important to find one that uses up-to-date online software. Some oilfield factors still require original invoices and other documents to be mailed in before they will buy them. This creates additional time and hassle. Finding a factoring company that has a system in place to receive and approve scanned invoices is crucial. Many factors today also use online software that allows you to review your funding transactions in real-time, from any location.</p>
<h2>Back-Office Services</h2>
<p>In addition to boosting cash flow, factoring can take a lot of work off of your company’s plate. Many factoring companies provide a range of back-office services, including customer collections and free credit analysis. The best factors provide a level of service that streamlines the collections process for your company and your customers. They understand that collecting payment in a prompt, professional manner is in everyone’s best interest.</p>
<p>The back-office services a factoring company provides can make a real difference to your company’s bottom line. You no longer have to spend time and resources on collections, allowing you to focus more effort on running and expanding your oilfield services business.</p>
<h2>Discounts and Other Services</h2>
<p>Some factors provide additional programs that can help oilfield fleets improve their bottom lines. Fuel cards, exclusive load boards and discounts on other services like lodging or paperwork are some of the additional perks your company might receive by factoring.</p>
<h2>Scalable Funding</h2>
<p>Factoring is more flexible than most forms of traditional financing. The amount of money your company can finance through factoring will grow as your receivables grow. The funding should never run out. For example, if your company’s monthly volume of invoices increases from $100,000 to $500,000 in a year’s time, factoring should be able to fund that growth.</p>
<p>Some factoring companies have stronger financial resources than others. When selecting a factor, be sure to ask the company’s representatives about their capital structure and customer base. Factors that have been in business for many years and are familiar with the oilfield services industry are the best bets to finance your company as it grows.</p>

170,0,Blog Posts,What Steve Jobs Knew About Career Comebacks ,What Steve Jobs Knew About Career Comebacks ,"<p>Everyone has highs and lows in their career. Sometimes a low point can seem like the bottom of a very deep pit. Steve Jobs had one such experience.</p>
<p>Yes, Steve Jobs, mastermind of the Mac computer, iPhone and many other Apple products, was once an outcast in the technology world. Jobs was a genius, but he had a difficult personality. In 1985, one year after Jobs launched the Macintosh, his abrasiveness and immaturity wore thin with Apple’s board of directors. Job was forced to resign from the company he had created.</p>
<p>Everyone reacts differently when their job or business suddenly ends. Some people struggle for years to recover. Others dust themselves off and start something new. In the case of Jobs, he went on to launch the legendary animation studio Pixar, which he sold to Disney for $7.4 billion. Then in 1997, Jobs returned to Apple and made it the most powerful consumer brand in the world.</p>
<p>Jobs had the most successful second and third acts in the history of business. None of us can expect that level of success. Like Jobs, however, we are all capable of rising up from a career setback when necessary.</p>
<p>Should you ever need them, here are five keys to staging your own business comeback:</p>
<h2>Dive into the Next Venture</h2>
<p>When he left Apple, Jobs was not interested in taking time off to decide what he wanted to do next. Instead, he started a new computer company called NeXT. A year later, Jobs also founded Pixar. Instead of reflecting on what went wrong at Apple, he poured his passion into two new companies.</p>
<p>The loss of a job or a business can be devastating. However, most of us do not have the luxury of waiting around to see what comes next. It pays to start formulating plans for your next venture. You might not have a clear vision of that next step, but putting things in motion is critical. Make a list of business contacts who can help you and connect with them over coffee or lunch. If you plan to start a new business, formulate a strategy for raising money and assembling resources. Network with industry colleagues and set goals for what you want to be doing two years from now.</p>
<p>Do not procrastinate or grieve over the past. Start authoring the next chapter in your career today.</p>
<h2>Learn From Your Mistakes</h2>
<p>Neither NeXT nor Pixar were successful right out of the gate. In fact, both companies lost money for several years. However, this was a period in which Jobs gained more confidence as a leader and innovator. “I’m the only person I know that’s lost a quarter of a billion dollars in one year,” he said. “It’s very character-building.”</p>
<p>When staging a career comeback, it is important to take note of past mistakes and things you might have done differently. The definition of insanity, after all, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Having the self-awareness to recognize your missteps and correct them can lead to greater success in your next initiative.</p>
<h2>Keep the Faith</h2>
<p>Every historic figure who made a difference in the world experienced at least one setback. George Washington had Valley Forge. Abraham Lincoln endured five years of bitter civil war. What separates history’s winners from everyone else is their abiding faith that, ultimately, they will succeed.</p>
<p>A career setback may seem like a disaster at the time. When you look back, however, it could represent a fresh start. It can be a chance for you to re-double your efforts or try something entirely new. Jobs maintained later in his life that losing his job at Apple was one of the best things that happened to him. It strengthened his resolve to keep doing something he loved—developing technology that changed the world. “Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick,” he once said. “Don’t lose faith.”</p>
<h2>Do What You Love</h2>
<p>One advantage of having your back against the wall is that, often, you have less to lose. The loss of a job or a business can be a good time to take a personal inventory and decide what you want to do next in your career. Do you want go in a different direction or stay on the same path? Jobs was a big believer that, if you follow your heart and intuition, everything else will eventually fall into place. The keys, he said, are identifying what you want to do in life, then remaining focused on that dream.</p>
<p>Jobs claimed that he woke up every morning, looked in the mirror and asked himself if what he was going to do that day was what he wanted to do. If the answer was, “no” for several consecutive days, he would make a change. Life is too short to be unhappy. When crafting your comeback, do not worry about prestige, income, failure or embarrassment. Decide what you want to do and pursue it.</p>
<h2>Visualize Your Success</h2>
<p>Your mind and emotions are powerful. Little can be accomplished without a positive attitude. Many medical doctors now believe that patients can increase their chances of overcoming serious illness by visualizing the healing process. The same is true in business. While pursuing your next venture, scroll ahead a few of years and visualize your success. Picture all those people who once doubted you now singing your praises. If you can imagine that success, you can make it happen.</p>
<p>When he was booted from Apple in 1985, Jobs spent a few days at home with the shades drawn. He listened for hours to Bob Dylan tapes, especially “The Times They Are a-Changing.” One stanza of that song became a rallying point for Jobs: “For the loser now/Will be later to win.”</p>

171,0,Blog Posts,What the Greatest Inventor Knew about Building a Better Business,What the Greatest Inventor Knew about Building a Better Business,"<p>When Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, he became an instant celebrity. The idea of recording and reproducing sounds on a grooved cylinder was so startling that some people thought Edison was a magician. Others called him the greatest inventor in the world. He was just 30 years old.</p>
<p>Edison could have lived comfortably as the creator of the first recording device. That, however, was not enough for him. Edison went on to launch an industrial research laboratory and amass more than a thousand patents. Most notably, he invented the motion picture camera and the first long-lasting light bulb.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you may have reached a point in which your company is operating comfortably. Like Edison, however, you might not be satisfied just coasting on your accomplishments. You want to do more, to aim higher.</p>
<p>Here are four key qualities of successful entrepreneurs who are always envisioning and driving toward their next triumph:</p>
<h2>Hard Work</h2>
<p>Edison had a brilliant mind, but he was also a tireless worker. He is famous for saying, “Genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration.” This philosophy can be applied to any field. Think of the people in your life who seem to pile up one big achievement after another. These are not always the smartest, most talented people in the room, but they all have one thing in common. They work hard. They are never satisfied with “good enough.”</p>
<h2>Embracing Failure</h2>
<p>Here is another Edison quote: “I have not failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” Inventing requires tremendous resolve because it is an experimental game of trial and error. Running a company also involves several false starts and ways that won’t work. Entrepreneurs who fear or avoid failure do not stay in business for very long. Those who are willing to attempt many different approaches until finding one that works will succeed in almost any pursuit. After all, the only time you really fail is when you choose to give up.</p>
<h2>Relishing the Journey</h2>
<p>One reason successful people keep on striving is because the satisfaction of a completed assignment is short-lived. The real joy comes from the journey rather than the destination. As a business owner, you may have many mundane tasks that you do not enjoy. When working toward your next goal, do not let those duties bog you down. Focus on what you love about your company, whether it is technology, the services you provide or the challenge of meeting customer needs. By making work more about your passions, the journey becomes gratifying and you might accomplish more than you expected. As Edison once put it, “I find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.”</p>
<h2>Encouraging Others</h2>
<p>Perhaps the ugliest moment of Edison’s life was when he launched an angry campaign against other companies competing in the fledgling electric power market. His petty bickering got Edison booted from the company he founded, which today is General Electric. In contrast, Edison achieved some of his greatest innovations by encouraging and inspiring other inventors at his research lab in Menlo Park, N.J.</p>
<p>Thomas Edison could not go it alone. Neither can you. Building a team of people you trust can make up for your personal shortcomings and lead to greater success. Rewarding and valuing the people around you will make you a better business owner. Your company will be stronger and more innovative. Like Edison, you might open the door to opportunities you could not have imagined.</p>

172,0,Blog Posts,Six Ways to Build Up Cash Flow for Your Trucking Fleet ,Six Ways to Build Up Cash Flow for Your Trucking Fleet ,"<p>One of the great myths about trucking and other service businesses is the idea that if you are profitable, you are doing all right. A healthy balance sheet is good, but having enough cash on hand to run your business is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>In trucking, where you must sometimes wait as long as two months between a completed haul and payment, building up adequate cash flow can be challenging. Here are six ways to quickly generate enough working capital to operate and expand your company:</p>
<h2>Factor Your Receivables</h2>
<p>Many trucking companies use factoring (also known as “accounts receivable financing”) as a quicker, easier alternative to a banking line of credit or other financing. A factoring provider can advance cash on your invoices within 24 hours, allowing you to quickly build up cash flow. You receive the balance of the invoice value, minus a small fee, when the factor receives payment from your customers. Not only does factoring allow you to turn your trucking company’s invoices into cash within a day, it also handles collections and other back-office work for your company.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to factor, read RTS Financial's free resource, <em>Your Complete Guide to Factoring</em>.</p>
<h2>Use Fuel Cards and Other Loyalty Programs</h2>
<p>There are two key advantages to signing your fleet up for a fuel card. First, the card provides discounts on fuel, maintenance and other purchases. Secondly, most cards provide detailed monthly reports on transactions and let you set restrictions on purchases. This eliminates the risk of your drivers fudging on their expense reports and costing your fleet more money. The per-gallon price of diesel is low right now, but you could always be paying even less. The best fuel cards offer average savings of several cents per gallon. Over the course of a year, those savings can free up thousands of dollars to help you meet other company expenses.</p>
<h2>Check Credit Information</h2>
<p>Shippers and freight brokers go belly-up all the time, leaving a trail of unpaid invoices. To guard against payment default, you should regularly check the credit ratings of the companies you serve. A low or declining credit score could mean that a customer or broker is in financial trouble. Armed with this information, you can decide if it is worth taking the risk of doing business with these companies. You do not necessarily have to pay for access to credit information. Some factoring companies and other financial providers offer free credit scores and days-to-pay information on thousands of brokers and shippers.</p>
<h2>Evaluate Your Insurance</h2>
<p>Insurance can be one of the biggest fixed costs for trucking companies. Is your company paying more on insurance than necessary? You should evaluate your fleet’s insurance policy at least once a year. If cash is tight, you might consider raising your deductible to lower your monthly premium payments. You will need to balance the advantage of a lower premium with the risk of future insurance claims.</p>
<p>Also, regularly checking your company’s credit rating is a good idea. If your credit rating improves, you could lock in a better insurance rate. Finally, it is always a good idea to shop around among various insurance providers. Can you get a better deal from another insurance company for a similarly solid policy? The answer is often “Yes.”</p>
<h2>Cut Unnecessary Expenses</h2>
<p>Another way to quickly build more cash flow is to cut spending that does not necessarily benefit your company. Take a critical eye to fixed costs like office space, payroll, equipment agreements and service providers. Can you lease a less-expensive property for your headquarters? Can some of your back-office work be outsourced to a third-party company? Even something as simple as switching telecom providers can potentially save your company hundreds of dollars per month.</p>
<h2>Stay Liquid</h2>
<p>When business is good, it can be tempting to pump your profits into newer equipment or additional headcount. However, it is also wise to put a portion of that extra money into investments that can be easily liquidated when you need the cash. Work with a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner to build a portfolio of stocks, bonds and other holdings where your money can grow until you need it. Another approach is to invest some earnings into real estate, though the volatility of that market might mean you have to cash out when your holdings have lost some of their value.</p>

203,0,Blog Posts,Survival Tips for a Slow Trucking Market,Survival Tips for a Slow Trucking Market,"<p>The past few months have been tough for carriers, as U.S. productivity has slowed and freight tonnage has declined. Here are six effective ways for your trucking company to get through the lean times:</p>
<h2>Work the Load Boards</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of load boards on the Internet. Some of them do not even charge a subscription. Build a list of load boards that offer the best loads on the lanes you serve and make a habit of visiting those boards often.</p>
<h2>Build Up Your Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Factoring your receivables is an effective way to bring in cash almost immediately instead of waiting 30 to 60 days on payments. Having working capital readily available can help your fleet survive a slumping market and grow when conditions improve. Factoring also provides more pricing stability that Quick Pay, which has rates as high as 4% from some brokers.</p>
<h2>Diversify Your Customer Base</h2>
<p>Counting on one or two customers for most of your business is a risky proposition in this economy. When possible, add new customers across different industries to make your business more recession-proof. Set a goal that no one customer will make up more than half of your revenue.</p>
<h2>Say No to Deadheading</h2>
<p>It always pays to find creative ways to avoid running your trucks with empty trailers. Finding back-hauls or reloads for return trips home or to other markets you serve will eliminate deadhead miles and improve your fleet’s bottom line.</p>
<h2>Cut Expenses</h2>
<p>Adopt a fuel card program that not only offers savings on diesel, but other expenses like maintenance, tires and paperwork. Consider outsourcing some of your back-office functions and take a critical eye at costs like office space, insurance and service providers.</p>
<h2>Check Credit Information</h2>
<p>Brokers and shippers go belly-up all the time, leaving a trail of unpaid invoices. To guard your fleet against payment defaults, regularly check the credit ratings of your existing and new clients and brokers.</p>

206,0,Blog Posts,Remember This Deduction on Your Trucking Company's 2016 Taxes  ,Remember This Deduction on Your Trucking Company's 2016 Taxes  ,"<h2 class=""margin-top-0"">An Expanded Deduction for Businesses</h2>
<p>Just days before Christmas 2015, Congress left a big gift under the tree that trucking companies and other businesses can use to save on their taxes for 2016.</p>
<p>Section 179 of the federal tax code allows companies to deduct money spent on equipment from their taxes. Congress’ “Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes” (PATH) Act, which President Obama signed into law on Dec. 21, 2015, permanently increased the annual cap on that deduction from $25,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>That increase means that 100% of the money a company spends on a wide range of different equipment during a single year is tax-deductible up to $500,000. The expanded deduction is permanent and retroactive, meaning companies can write off up to $500,000 in expenses on purchased or leased equipment on their 2015 taxes.</p>
<h2>Bonus Depreciation Extended</h2>
<p>In other good news for businesses, the PATH Act also extended the 50% bonus depreciation through 2019. Companies of all sizes will be able to depreciate 50% of the cost of equipment acquired and used during 2016 and 2017. The bonus depreciation will be phased down to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019.</p>
<p>All companies can benefit from the expansion of Section 179. However, the $500,000 cap is especially valuable for small and start-up companies that need to acquire more assets. Equipment that qualifies for the Section 179 deduction includes machines purchased for business use, air conditioning and heating units, vehicles that weigh more than 6,000 lbs., computers, software, office equipment and office furniture.</p>

	<li>We advance up to 95% of the invoice amount.</li>
	<li>Easy account set-up that takes less than a week</li>
	<li>Scalable, debt-free funding that matches the growth of your company</li>

230,0,Blog Posts,The Seven Biggest Challenges Facing Trucking Companies Today,The Seven Biggest Challenges Facing Trucking Companies Today,"<p>The trucking industry is rapidly growing, but also presents several challenges for small- and medium-sized carriers. Here are the most pressing issues in trucking today:</p>
<h2>Regulations</h2>
<p>From hours-of-service to E-log devices to fuel emission requirements, government rules dictate almost everything about operating a truck. Most of the rules are designed to make trucking safer, but they also create a lot of red tape and extra expense for drivers and fleets.</p>
<h2>Fuel Savings</h2>
<p>Although diesel prices are currently low, saving on fuel and increasing fuel efficiency remain priorities for fleets of all sizes. Fuel card programs are one solution, providing discounts on diesel and many other services for trucking companies.</p>
<h2>Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Trucking fleets may wait as long as 60 to 90 days to get paid by brokers and shippers. This extended cycle can drain a fleet’s cash flow and limit growth. Factoring—also called “accounts receivable financing”—turns fleets’ invoices into cash in less than a day, quickly building up their working capital.</p>
<h2>Driver Retention</h2>
<p>There is a shortage of 48,000 truck drivers nationwide. Meanwhile, driver turnover rates are nearly 100%. To recruit and retain drivers, many fleets are boosting salaries, improving benefits and offering performance bonuses.</p>
<h2>Driver Health</h2>
<p>Truck drivers are twice as likely as other workers to be obese, have diabetes and not have health insurance. Poor health also puts drivers at risk for sleep apnea and other disorders. Recently, organizations like Rolling Strong, the Truckload Carriers Association and many trucking fleets have launched programs promoting better driver fitness.</p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>Accidents and fatalities have increased in recent years as more trucks and other vehicles share the highways. New “sensing” technology that helps trucks avoid collisions should help reduce the number of accidents in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Recent studies rank the United States’ highway infrastructure as 16th among developed countries. Without more public funding for roads and bridges, there will be more accidents, more delays and less profit for trucking companies in the future.</p>

239,0,Blog Posts,Nine Ways to Survive a Slow Trucking Market—and Prepare for a Rebound ,Nine Ways to Survive a Slow Trucking Market—and Prepare for a Rebound ,"<p>In 2014, trucking was in pretty good shape. An increase in shipping demand, combined with a shortage of trucking capacity, helped boost load rates and drove more revenue for most carriers.</p>
<p>Today, the trucking industry is in the middle of a slowdown. A mild winter in early 2016 did nothing to increase freight tonnage from shippers who are skittish about the economy. Today, instead of a capacity shortage, there are plenty of trucks and equipment available, fuel is still cheap and load rates have taken a hit.</p>
<p>Business might be slow right now for your trucking company, forcing you to make some tough decisions. Fortunately, there are many tactics you can implement to get through the tough times and prepare for a friendlier market. Here are nine strategies you might consider:</p>
<h2>Devise a Backup Plan</h2>
<p>Veteran fleet owners and independent owner-operators who have lived through a few cycles in the trucking business know that the good times do not last forever. To protect your company and your employees, you need a Plan B that you can put into action during the lean times. What kind of work can your people and equipment do when rates and traffic are down in the lanes you usually serve?</p>
<p>In coming up with an effective backup plan, you need to pay careful attention to the market. What areas of the country are seeing better growth and freight movement? Could your fleet benefit from serving different shippers and population centers that have higher demand? If you lease most of your fleet’s equipment, would now be a good time to shift into a different trucking mode that is moving more tonnage at better rates?</p>
<p>While most of the trucking industry is experiencing a slowdown, there are still good opportunities. Big fleets are outsourcing as much as 42% of their freight to smaller carriers. Short-haul and parcel carriers like UPS and FedEx are thriving from the expansion of ecommerce. Can your fleet play a role in one of these expanding areas of the market? While times are tough right now, this might present a chance to retool your fleet while putting your drivers and power units to work.</p>
<h2>Find New Income Streams</h2>
<p>Using your connections and familiarity with the trucking business can help you generate some cash on the side. One way of doing this is by becoming an agent for RTS Financial. When you refer a friend or a business contact to RTS Financial’s factoring services, you receive a commission each month for as long as your referral remains an RTS Financial client. It is an easy way to generate steady income with very little effort on your part. To learn more about this opportunity, visit our <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/page/agent-program"">Agent Program page</a>.</p>
<h2>Analyze Your Cash Flow</h2>
<p>You need to know how much money moves through your company and if that cash flow is going to be enough to sustain it. Do you have any money left over after paying your bills and one-time expenses? If your company is not yet profitable, you need to know your break-even point. Your company is breaking even when revenue equals all of your fixed and variable costs. You need to determine a profit margin that funds your company while also allowing you to put some money away to get through the lean times. For more information about financial statements and cash flow, read our guide, Financial Management for Trucking Companies (link to guide page).</p>
<h2>Set Realistic Revenue Goals</h2>
<p>One mistake some trucking fleets made two years ago was trying to grow too fast. Today, some of those businesses are cutting jobs or closing their doors. If your company is still new to trucking, study your market and develop some revenue goals that are ambitious but achievable. Have a plan for how you will handle that growth through available cash, headcount and assets. Likewise, plan to have some cash on hand when new business opportunities dry up. Growth is good, but it will initially drain cash and other assets. Be careful when planning your company’s growth.</p>
<h2>Stay Liquid</h2>
<p>When times are good, it is tempting to pump all of your profits into buying new equipment and adding headcount to your company. The smarter play is to put a portion of that money into investments that can be liquidated when your company needs the cash. Work with a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner to build a portfolio of stocks, bonds and mutual funds where your money will grow until you need it. Another approach is to invest some earnings into real estate, though it is not as liquid as the stock market. Volatility in the real estate market might mean you have to cash out when your holdings have lost some of their value.</p>
<h2>Reduce Costs</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to explore areas where you can cut spending without damaging your business. Take a critical eye to fixed costs like office space, payroll, equipment agreements and service providers. Can you lease less-expensive office space? Can you outsource some of your back-office functions to companies that specialize in that work? Even something as simple as switching telecom providers can potentially save your company hundreds of dollars per month.</p>
<p>Consider doing away with anything that is not essential to your business, from the copier you never use to the breakroom coffee machine. For contracts that are up for renewal, try renegotiating terms that are more favorable. Finally, as an alternative to layoffs, consider implementing a temporary, across-the-board salary reduction. Your employees will appreciate your keeping them on the payroll. That goodwill may pay off for your business when the market improves.</p>
<h2>Know When You Need Financing</h2>
<p>The right time to seek outside funding is before the point when your company desperately needs it. Avoid the mistake that many business owners make by waiting too long to get financing.</p>
<p>Understanding your company’s strengths and weaknesses, your available cash flow and your market are essential. Do you need capital to survive a downturn or to purchase equipment and trucks? Different stages in your company’s life can call for different forms of financing. Factoring, or accounts receivable financing, may be a good fit because you incur no debt and there are no limits to the amount of funding (link to “What is Factoring article).</p>
<p>At other times, you may be willing to take on debt to fuel your company’s growth. It is important to plan your debt so that it follows the life of the asset it is financing. For example, taking out a five-year loan for equipment that fully depreciates in three years is a bad financing strategy.</p>
<h2>Manage Risks</h2>
<p>Calculate the benefits of financing for your company (growth, sustainability) against the risks (debt, default). Can your company afford to take on debt? How much should you borrow? Are you comfortable putting property, equipment or even your own home up as collateral? Could your company survive if you default? Explore all your financing options, from alternative lenders to banks, to find the right fit.</p>
<p>Also, take a strategic approach to managing your assets. Does your company really need brand-new trucks and equipment to operate effectively? New equipment often requires big down-payments and interest that can eat up your cash flow. Equipment lease agreements are more flexible and require less working capital.</p>
<h2>Seek Advice from Reliable Sources</h2>
<p>Building a first-rate company that endures ups and downs in the trucking market will require some outside expertise. You need to assemble a team of advisors who know your industry and have more than just a monetary interest in your company’s growth. This team can include bankers, CPAs, financial planners, legal counsel and other lenders like a factoring company.</p>
<p>Not all of your advisors need to come from the legal or financial community. You can benefit from friendships with other fleet owners who are veterans of the industry. Seek out mentors and consider forming an advisory board of entrepreneurs. You will need some outside help in building a business that will last in the challenging trucking industry.</p>

242,0,Blog Posts,How to Get Loads That Pay Well,How to Get Loads That Pay Well,"<p>In today’s challenging freight market, you need to do more than check the load boards to find hauls that pay well enough for your fleet to make money.</p>
<p>Low fuel prices and plenty of capacity have created a shipper’s market in trucking. As of May 2016, spending on freight was down 10% from last year, according to the Cass Freight Index. Succeeding today requires a strategic approach to finding loads and the discipline to pass on shipments that might not help your business.</p>
<p>Here are seven steps that can increase your chances of getting good loads, and working with shippers or brokers that pay well and on time:</p>
<h2>Know Your Financials</h2>
<p>Your first step is to know what represents a profitable load for your company. That requires an understanding of your fleet’s operating costs, available cash and revenue. Many trucking companies take on money-losing loads because they do not pay enough attention to their own financials.</p>
<p>To avoid that trap, you need to calculate what range of load rates will make money for your company. What represents a good rate may change depending on the time of year, how much cash you have on hand and what lanes you are running. For more information on this, read our articles, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/trucking-calculations-formulas"">“How to Calculate Cost per Mile for Your Trucking Company,”</a> and <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/how-calculate-revenue-and-profit-mile"">“How to Calculate Revenue and Profit per Mile.”</a></p>
<h2>Develop Criteria</h2>
<p>Take a pen and write a list of the most important qualities you need in a broker or a shipper. Your list may look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pays on time</li>
<li>Good communicator</li>
<li>Is direct and decisive</li>
<li>Provides loads regularly</li>
<li>Has a good reputation</li>
<li>Is financially secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every shipper or broker you work with will meet all of these specifications. However, having a list of criteria sets a standard for your company. Your list can help you focus on long-term business partners who can provide steady income.</p>
<h2>Pick Your Lanes</h2>
<p>A load from Chicago to Houston paying $2.00 a mile may sound good, but does it make sense for your business? If your trailer is going to be empty on the way back from Texas, was the job really worth it?</p>
<p>When selecting loads, make sure they are in trucking lanes that work for your business. Keep in mind the expense of hauling through the Rockies and other rugged parts of the country. Also, plan ahead by choosing shipments that allow you to make money on the way back home. To learn more about this, read our article, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/benefits-backhauls-and-re-loads"">“The Benefits of Backhauls and Re-Loads.”</a></p>
<h2>Start Networking</h2>
<p>The first place most truckers look for new loads is a load board. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is also a good idea to use other methods for finding shippers. For example, local, state or national industry associations can provide access to companies that ship. So does your local chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>When you join these organizations, they often provide a list of all of their member companies, including emails, phone numbers and people to contact. Let’s say you have a flatbed fleet and you decide to join the regional homebuilder’s association. Not only do you get to interact with potential clients at association events, you also get a prospect list you can use to market your services.</p>
<h2>Work the Phones</h2>
<p>Once you have a list of prospects, you need to call them. Try to reach an organization’s transportation manager or whoever else is in charge of shipping. If you cannot speak with the right decision-maker, follow up with an email.</p>
<p>Cold-calling prospects can be a draining experience. The advantage, however, is that very few fleets are willing to do some selling to generate business. While most other truckers are flooding the load boards in search of new hauls, you can develop a source of new business with very little direct competition.</p>
<h2>Check Credit Scores</h2>
<p>Knowing the credit ratings and days-to-pay information on a broker or shipper improves your chances of making the right business decisions and getting paid on time. Our affiliate, <a href=""http://www.rtscredit.com/"">RTS Credit</a>, has information on more than 50,000 brokers and shippers, and can be accessed for free by RTS Financial and RTS Carrier Services customers.</p>
<h2>Take a Strategic Approach to Load Boards</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of load boards on the internet and most of them charge a monthly subscription. The most popular boards include <a href=""http://www.dat.com/"">DAT</a>, <a href=""https://truckstop.com/"">TruckStop.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.getloaded.com/"">GetLoaded.com</a>. Do some research and look for load boards that offer good rates in the lanes you want to serve. Signing up on a handful of reliable boards increases your chances of getting the best loads. You will also want to post a profile about your company on each load board so that shippers have a way of finding you.</p>

244,0,Blog Posts,Will a Bigger Panama Canal Transform U.S. Freight?  Not Anytime Soon.,Will a Bigger Panama Canal Transform U.S. Freight?  Not Anytime Soon.,"<p>It took nine years and $5.4 billion to build, but the Panama Canal officially opened its third lane on Sunday, June 26. The expansion allows the 102-year-old canal to accommodate massive cargo ships that carry as many as 14,000 containers. The first ship to pass through the canal’s two newly-constructed locks on June 26 held 9,400 containers, nearly twice the capacity of the 5,000-container ships that the canal previously handled.</p>

<p>The expansion of the Panama Canal is expected to have an impact on the movement of freight in the United States. More than 60% of the canal’s container traffic either comes from or goes to ports on the East Coast. Now that bigger ships can pass through Panama, the amount of freight moving through the Eastern half of the U.S. could increase significantly. More than 170 of the gigantic “neo-Panamax” ships have reservations to move through the canal’s expanded locks. In a recent speech, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx described the enlarged canal as “a dynamic that’s changing freight.”</p>

<p>Bigger ships could be good news for U.S. trucking fleets mired in a slow freight market. However, most transportation experts agree that it could take years for a larger Panama Canal to have a big impact on freight tonnage and load rates. Here are four reasons why:</p>

<h2>East Coast Ports are Not Ready</h2>

<p>Currently, only three ports on the East Coast—Miami, Baltimore and Norfolk, Va.—can accommodate the bigger ships that will now move through the Panama Canal. Dredging projects are underway in Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. that will allow those ports to serve the largest container vessels in about two years. The Bayonne Bridge near the port of New York and New Jersey is too low for ships carrying up to 14,000 containers to enter the port. The port authority is spending $1.3 billion to raise the bridge 60 feet, a project that will not be complete until late 2017.</p>

<p>The lack of infrastructure on the East Coast to handle the larger ships is a big reason transportation experts like FTR’s Larry Gross think the Panama Canal will have a minor effect on shipping in the near term. “There was discussion at some time that this was going to be a game-changer,” Gross told <em>Fleet Owner </em>magazine. “I don’t view it as a game-changer.”</p>

<h2>The Freight Market Remains Sluggish</h2>

<p>Greater capacity in the canal means that more cargo can pass through, but it does not mean that consumers will start buying more products. Freight volumes in 2015 and 2016 have stagnated in the face of slow economic growth and high inventory levels for retailers. Freight tonnage moved by truck and rail in May was down 5.8% from a year ago, according to the Cass Freight Index. Publicly-traded trucking fleets like Werner Enterprises and Swift Transportation have recently slashed their earnings expectations.</p>

<p>Until consumers start spending more, the Panama Canal’s expansion will not have a major effect on the freight industry.</p>

<h2>Shippers Might Not Divert More Freight to the East Coast</h2>

<p>Panamanian officials expanded the canal with the expectation that it would divert more freight from Asia to the East Coast. Right now, the most direct route for moving freight from China to the U.S. is through the West Coast, but congestion and recent labor disputes have made West Coast ports less attractive to shippers. A recent report by C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. and Boston Consulting Group estimated about 10% of Asian container traffic to the U.S. would shift from the West Coast to East Coast ports by 2020.</p>

<p>For that to happen, however, shippers will have to accept a longer route from Asia through Panama, as well as the tolls the canal charges. Sending one neo-Panamax ship through the 50-mile Panama Canal will cost an estimated $800,000. It remains to be seen how many shippers will prefer that cost to shorter intermodal transits through the West Coast.</p>

<h2>There May Be Problems with the Canal’s Expansion</h2>

<p>Time will tell, but questions remain as to how well the two massive, new locks will serve the Panama Canal. In 2009, officials for the canal awarded the project to the lowest bidder, and the expansion took two years longer than expected to complete.</p>

<p>In a recent investigative piece, <em>The New York Times</em> interviewed dozens of contractors, canal workers and maritime experts about the canal expansion. Many of those interviewed expressed doubts that the new locks had enough water, were made of durable concrete and were large enough to safely accommodate big cargo ships. One consultant interviewed by the <em>Times</em> also claimed that the canal was at risk for an earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter Scale.</p>

<p>If the improvements to the Panama Canal do not live up to their billing, there could be disappointing consequences for both shippers and transportation companies in the United States.</p>

248,0,Blog Posts,Six Quick Facts about Factoring ,Six Quick Facts about Factoring ,"<p>Are you on the fence about factoring? Perhaps you need to build up your company’s cash flow, but you are concerned about committing to an agreement with a factoring provider?</p>
<p>Below are six quick facts that might ease your mind about factoring as a financial tool. To learn more about how factoring works, you can also read our free resource, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-factoring""><strong><em>Your Complete Guide to Factoring</em></strong></a>.</p>
<h2>1.) Setting up an account is quick and painless.</h2>
<p>It can take weeks and sometimes months to apply for and secure a traditional credit line. You can open an account with most factoring providers (also known as “factors”) in less than a week. Also, the amount of required paperwork to start factoring is less cumbersome than with many other forms of financing.</p>
<h2>2.) Your customers’ credit histories are more important than your own.</h2>
<p>Even if your personal and company credit scores are not the strongest, that is not the greatest concern when factoring. A factor is going to focus more on your customers’ credit histories and financial health. Since the factor will be buying your invoices and handling collections, your customers’ ability to pay on time is more crucial to the factoring agreement.</p>
<h2>3.) The funding grows as your company grows.</h2>
<p>With most factors, there is no limit to the amount of funding you can receive as long as you remain a client. It is common for factoring companies to fund receivables totaling in the millions of dollars per month. Unlike a line of credit, there is no cap to factoring. There is also no debt.</p>
<h2>4.) Factoring is faster and more flexible than Quick Pay.</h2>
<p>If you operate a trucking company, you might use Quick Pay to receive cash on your invoices earlier. Quick Pay usually takes two to three days, whereas many factors can fund your invoices in 24 hours or less. Factoring is also more flexible. Not all freight brokers offer Quick Pay funding. However, there is no limit to the amount of receivables you can fund with a factoring provider.</p>
<h2>5.) You will see a difference in your cash flow.</h2>
<p>The main benefit of factoring for your company is the quick injection of cash flow. Instead of waiting 30 to 60 days on customer payments, you can receive advances of up to 97% on your invoice values within a day. Under this arrangement, the cash quickly builds up, allowing you to address operating costs and even expand your business.</p>
<h2>6.) You do not have to factor all of your receivables.</h2>
<p>Factoring does not have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. As a factoring client, you may choose to fund some receivables and not others. This measured approach can help your company and accounting team become more familiar with factoring. If the ease of factoring turns out to be a good fit for your company, you can choose to add more receivables in the future.</p>

249,0,Blog Posts,How to Bid on Government Contract Work,How to Bid on Government Contract Work,"<p>Regardless of who gets elected in November, one thing you can be sure of is that the government will continue to spend big money on contracts.</p>
<p>Last year, the federal government spent an estimated $439 billion across 31,000 contracts. That amount does not even include the billions of dollars that state and local government agencies spend each year.</p>
<p>In short, there is a lot of money to be made in contracting for the government. However, bidding on government contracts can be a drawn-out process that takes several months. It is also highly competitive, as you are likely to be bidding against experienced government vendors.</p>
<p>If your company is fairly new to bidding on public sector work, these eight tips can help you win your share of RFPs from the federal, state and local governments:</p>
<h2>Determine if You Are a Small Business</h2>
<p>Being classified as a small business can be a huge advantage. The federal government is required to commit at least 23% of its contract work to small businesses each year. To learn what the government considers to be a small business in your industry, explore the North American Industry Classification codes <a href=""http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012""><strong>here</strong></a>. The site includes a table that lists the maximum number of employees and revenue that contractors can have and still qualify as a small business.</p>
<h2>Register Your Company</h2>
<p>Your company will need a Dun & Bradstreet “D-U-N-S” number for each of its locations before you can do business with the government. You can quickly obtain these nine-digit numbers for free at the <a href=""http://www.dnb.com/duns-number.html""><strong>Dun & Bradstreet website</strong></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will also need to register your company in the government’s System for Award Management (SAM). Registration is free, and setting up a user account allows you to track the status of your bids. You can also view how many of your industry competitors are already doing business with the government. Visit the <a href=""https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11""><strong>SAM User Guide</strong></a> to learn more about this part of the process.</p>
<h2>Be Selective</h2>
<p>For the federal government alone, there are at least 31,000 contracting opportunities. Combing through all of them is not practical. Once you have selected the government agencies you want to work with, there are a handful of websites where you can find contract solicitations and opportunities. Those sites include <a href=""https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Default.aspx""><strong>USAspending.gov</strong></a>, and <a href=""https://www.fbo.gov/""><strong>FedBizOpps.gov</strong></a>. The <a href=""http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104109""><strong>General Services Administration’s web site</strong></a> has information on upcoming and long-term contracts. Marketing resources like ONVIA or ImmixGroup can also help you find the right kind of government work for your company.</p>
<h2>Bring Your “A” Game</h2>
<p>Bidding on federal contracts is a strict, rigorous process that can take several months. To be considered, your company will need to write an engaging bid proposal, present a viable solution and participate in negotiations over the contract. Depending on the agency, there may be several steps to the process, including Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ), and Invitation for Bid (IFB). Because you will be working with the government, be prepared to share more financial information about your company than you would when bidding on a commercial project.</p>
<p>Each agency of the U.S. government has its own procurement arm. Once you select the agency you want to work with, you need to familiarize yourself with how that agency handles the bidding process. As with any business proposal, it helps to understand the agency’s pain points. What kind of expertise or product is needed and how can your company address that need?</p>
<h2>Consider Becoming a Subcontractor</h2>
<p>You do not have to do business directly with the government. In fact, becoming a subcontractor for a larger company will spare you much of the time and paperwork that goes with government bidding. Large government suppliers have their own data networks and you may have to register with them to become a subcontractor. Another resource is <a href=""https://www.supplier-connection.net/SupplierConnection/index.html""><strong>Supplier Connection</strong></a>, an IBM-powered website that connects small businesses with major government suppliers like AT&T, Du Pont, UPS and more.</p>
<h2>Emphasize Your Advantages</h2>
<p>Over the years the federal government has taken several steps to even the playing field in the bidding process between larger and smaller companies. In addition to committing nearly a quarter of its contract business to smaller companies, the government also reserves opportunities for traditionally disadvantaged groups. These include companies that are owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans. Companies that are based in economically troubled regions under the government’s HUBZone program can also gain an advantage in the bidding process.</p>
<p>If your company falls under any of these categories, be sure to use them to your advantage in the bidding process. To learn if your company qualifies as a HUBZone business, visit <a href=""https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/hubzone-program/hubzone-maps""><strong>SBA.gov</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Go Local</h2>
<p>You may find that your company has more of a competitive advantage when bidding on contract work that is closer to home. To do business with a particular state, county or city, you will need to understand the procurement process that particular jurisdiction uses. For most states, that usually starts with a visit to the state’s department of administration or general services website.</p>
<p>One advantage of bidding on state and local contract work is you may have more face-to-face contact with key decision makers. Relationships are just as important in government contract work as with any other business opportunity. In addition to completing all the paperwork involved in the bidding process, look for opportunities to meet and network with government officials whenever possible.</p>
<h2>Seek a Mentor</h2>
<p>Before you delve into the bidding process, it helps to learn from professionals who have experience in marketing their services to the government. If you do not know anyone who can guide you through the process, the government provides two mentoring programs for companies that want to do contract work. The General Services Administration’s <a href=""http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/108195""><strong>Mentor-Protégé Program</strong></a> matches business owners with experienced government contractors. The <a href=""http://www.sba.gov""><strong>Small Business Administration</strong></a> also provides information and mentor programs that help companies get started as contractors for the government.</p>

258,0,Blog Posts,How Factoring Can Propel Your Aviation Company ,How Factoring Can Propel Your Aviation Company ,"<p>If your company works in aviation and aerospace, you know first-hand how much the industry has grown in recent years.</p>
<p>Expanding foreign markets like India, China and Brazil have fueled more demand for commercial air travel and represent tremendous growth opportunities for aviation companies in the United States. Manufacturers Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer have predicted the world’s aircraft fleet will more than double—to more than 40,000 planes—in 20 years. This is great news for companies that supply, perform maintenance and do overhauls for commercial as well as private aircrafts.</p>
<p>Growth is good, but having enough cash on hand to serve aviation customers can sometimes be a steep challenge. Factoring your company’s receivables could be the best way to quickly elevate your company’s cash flow. There are several other benefits that factoring companies--also sometimes called “factors”--provide their clients.</p>
<p>Here are five key advantages that factoring offers today:</p>
<h2>Faster Payment</h2>
<p>Factoring allows your company to receive payment on its receivables almost immediately instead of waiting 30 to 60 days on a customer payment. A factoring company buys your invoices and advances cash on those invoices in less than a day. The factor then collects payment from your customers and sends your company the remaining balances of the invoice values.</p>
<p>Same-day funding of your aviation company’s receivables allows you to quickly build up cash flow to pay employees, meet customer demands and continue to expand your business.</p>
<h2>Scalable Funding</h2>
<p>Unlike a traditional line of credit, there is no limit to the amount of funding you can receive through factoring. As your receivables grow, the cash you receive from factoring matches that growth. For example, if your aviation company’s monthly volume of invoices increases from $50,000 to $150,000 in a year’s time, the same-day funding from factoring will scale up to meet that growth.</p>
<p>Some factoring companies have stronger financial resources than others. When selecting a factor, be sure to ask the company’s representatives about their capital structure and customer base. Factors that have been in business for many years and are familiar with the aviation industry are the best bets to finance your company as it grows.</p>
<h2>Easy Account Set-Up</h2>
<p>Securing a bank loan or another form of traditional funding can take several weeks and involve a lot of documentation and paperwork. With most factors, your company can set up an account and start receiving same-day funding of receivables in less than a week.</p>
<p>The approval process for factoring is straightforward and less demanding. Even if your company is a start-up or has a less-than-stellar credit score, you can qualify for financing. A factoring provider will be mostly concerned about your customers’ credit and payment histories, not your own.</p>
<h2>User-Friendly Technology</h2>
<p>When selecting a factoring company, it is important to find one that uses up-to-date online account software. Some factors still require original invoices and other documents to be mailed in before they will buy them. This creates additional time and hassle.</p>
<p>Finding a factoring company that has a system in place to receive and approve scanned or digital invoices is crucial. Many factors today also use online software that allows you to review your funding transactions in real-time, from any location. This gives you a clear picture of your company’s available cash flow at any given moment.</p>
<h2>Back-Office Services</h2>
<p>In addition to boosting cash flow, factoring can take a lot of work off of your company’s plate. Many factoring companies provide a range of back-office services, including customer collections and free credit analysis. The best factors provide a level of service that streamlines the collections process for your aviation company and your customers. The factor should understand that collecting payment in a prompt, professional manner is in everyone’s best interest.</p>
<p>The back-office services that factoring provides can make a real difference to your company’s bottom line. You no longer have to spend time and resources on collections, allowing you to focus more effort on finding new customers for your aviation company.</p>

260,0,Blog Posts,How to Improve Your Accounts Receivable Process ,How to Improve Your Accounts Receivable Process ,"<p>As a business owner, you have little control over how soon your customers pay you. However, there are a few things you can do to help shorten the payment cycle. One is to examine your accounts receivable process. If your company’s cash flow is suffering because of the amount of time it takes customers to pay, you can take steps to fine-tune your movement of receivables.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to ask when analyzing your company’s accounts receivable process:</p>
<h2>How long does it take to get an invoice out?</h2>
<p>Once your company completes work for a customer, the clock starts ticking on your payment cycle. Deciding when to cut an invoice, guiding it through the approval process and delivering it to your customer all add precious time to the process. Upon receiving the invoice, your customers make their own decisions on timing their payments in ways that optimize their cash flow.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want a process in place that is attuned to when your company completes work and can deliver an invoice within the same day. If your accounts receivable requires days to process an invoice, that just prolongs the payment cycle and hurts your company’s ability to generate working capital.</p>
<h2>Are your customers motivated to pay faster?</h2>
<p>There are some steps you can take to gently push your customers into paying on time or even early. One way is to start making collection calls before the payment is overdue. Make it a practice to touch base with your customers via phone or email the exact date payment is due, rather than waiting 45 days or longer. If your customers know you are diligent about collecting on receivables, they are more likely to pay on time to get you off their back.</p>
<p>You can also provide incentives for early payments. You might be reluctant to knock 10% off the invoice value for payments within 15 days. However, your cash flow will benefit if the discount drives faster payments from some of your customers.</p>
<h2>How clear are your terms?</h2>
<p>Although net 30 is the expected payment term in most industries, it helps to specifically spell out your terms in invoicing, agreements and other customer correspondence. Your company’s policies and procedures need to be clear and consistent.</p>
<p>However, you should build some flexibility into your accounts receivable process for special circumstances. If a valued customer is having trouble paying on time and in full, you might adjust your terms to accommodate the customer. This helps ensure you are receive at least a portion of the payments due.</p>
<h2>Where are the internal bottlenecks in your process?</h2>
<p>If it takes days to send out an invoice, or if most customers wait 60 to 90 days to pay, you need to take steps to tighten your internal process. Is there poor communication between operations and accounts receivable? Is your company making collection calls in a timely manner? Is the technology you use outdated and unreliable? These are some of the bottlenecks that might be adding days to your payment cycle.</p>
<h2>How easy do you make it for the customer to pay?</h2>
<p>Ideally, your accounts receivable process should be as automated as possible and conducive to how customers expect to receive invoices and make payments. More and more businesses today use sophisticated accounting software that makes paying an invoice as simple as a mouse click for customers. When taking on new business, get a feel for how tech-savvy your new customers are and if they prefer to handle their transactions digitally.</p>

261,0,Blog Posts,How Trump’s Tax Plan Might Affect Your Business ,How Trump’s Tax Plan Might Affect Your Business ,"<p>Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency due in large part to his promise to lower income taxes for individuals and corporations.</p>
<p>Since Trump will work with a Republican-led Congress next year, there is a good chance that a tax reform bill will be passed. Those changes to the tax code could affect how much you and your business pay in taxes for 2017.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how Trump’s tax plan might change and how much of it will be adopted by Congress. Below are details of what the incoming president billed as the “Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act” during his 2016 campaign:</p>
<h2>Individual Taxes</h2>
<p>Trump has pledged to simplify the tax code for individuals, reducing it from seven different income brackets to three. Here is how it would break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxpayers with a household income of up to $75,300 (or up to $37,650 for an individual) would see a tax rate reduction from 15% to 12%.</li>
<li>Taxpayers with a household include of as much as $231,450 ($190,150 for an individual) would see their rate decline from 28% to 25%.</li>
<li>Taxpayers with household income above $231,450 ($190,150 for an individual) would pay 33%--down from 35% or 39.6%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Trump’s plan, the standard deduction would increase—from $6,350 to $15,000 for single individuals and from $12,700 to $30,000 for married couples. Trump proposes eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which is a supplemental tax for individuals, corporations or trusts that qualify for a lower standard income tax. Trump would also shed a 3.8% net investment tax on passive income, including capital gains.</p>
<h2>Business Taxes</h2>
<p>Trump’s plan calls for slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, as well as eliminating the AMT for businesses. Small business owners might also be able to avoid paying the 33% individual income tax by putting their assets into “pass-through” entities like sole proprietorships, partnerships or S corporations. Under the president-elect’s proposal, pass-through entities would be taxed at a flat 15% rate.</p>
<p>Trump has also proposed expanding the Section 179 expensing deduction that is used by many small businesses. The annual cap on Section 179 would increase from $500,000 to $1 million.</p>
<p>Materials for the Trump campaign have also indicated that many business tax incentives would be eliminated in exchange for the lower income tax rate. The research and development tax credit, however, would stay in place. Manufacturing companies would also be allowed to deduct any new investments into their businesses.</p>
<h2>Last-Minute Provisions</h2>
<p>As you conduct your year-end 2016 tax planning, pay close attention to Congress. The outgoing Congress—or the 115th Congress that takes power in January—may approve last-minute provisions that affect individual or corporate taxes. Energy and energy efficiency tax credits, as well as the mortgage insurance deduction, are set to expire at the end of 2016 if Congress does not vote to extend them.</p>

263,0,Blog Posts,Ready for Growth in 2017? Here are Six Ways to Get There. ,Ready for Growth in 2017? Here are Six Ways to Get There. ,"<p>There are many reasons to be optimistic about how your business will perform in 2017. Consumer spending is rising, manufacturing and transportation are rebounding, capital spending is increasing, and a new president takes office later this month.</p>
<p>The new year is a good time to adopt some measures that help your business capitalize on an improving economy and get through the sluggish times as well. Here are five steps that will get your business on stronger financial footing and poised for future growth:</p>
<h2>Devise a Growth Strategy</h2>
<p>You want to grow your business this year, but how are you going to do it? Take some time to put your 2017 goals down on paper, along with the steps you must take to reach those goals. Plotting out a growth strategy helps you pinpoint what’s most important for your company and what realistic solutions you need to implement.</p>
<h2>Explore New Technology</h2>
<p>If you are still using a ledger to keep track of your company’s transactions, it is time for an upgrade. There are many software programs on the market today that will make your accounting easier, more efficient and more accurate. These products’ automated accounts receivable functions might even help you get paid faster. Online software products like <a href=""http://www.quickbooks.com"">Quickbooks</a>, <a href=""http://www.xero.com"">Xero</a> or <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com"">Freshbooks</a> offer free 30-day trials and can cost your business as little as $6.30 per month.</p>
<h2>Calculate Your Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Because cash is the lifeblood of any business, it helps to have a general idea of how much money will flow through your pipeline at any given time. If you have not done so already, now is a good time to start a <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-cash-flow-budget-and-why-do-you-need-one"">cash flow budget</a>. Your calculations in a cash flow budget (sometimes called a “cash flow forecast”) do not have to be perfect. Making an informed estimate as to what your cash position will be over the next six months—and revising it monthly—can eliminate surprises and ensure you always have enough money available.</p>
<h2>Focus on Credit</h2>
<p>Having access to <a href=""http://www.rtscredit.com"">up-to-date, reliable credit information</a> allows you to make better business decisions. Knowing your clients’ credit scores and days-to-pay data can help you better manage cash flow and plan for the future.</p>
<p>On the flip side, now may be a good time to get your own business credit in order. Paying down existing debt, consolidating all your accounts and loans under your business, and even applying for credit you do not currently need are key steps in building a stronger credit rating.</p>
<h2>Shave Expenses</h2>
<p>Improving your company’s profit margin starts with cutting fixed and variable costs wherever you can. Can you easily spend less on office space, insurance, utilities and other monthly expenses? Does it make economic sense to lease instead of buy new equipment? Finally, are you taking full advantage of available savings programs? Just a few adjustments in the way you do business can potentially save your company thousands of dollars over the course of the next year.</p>
<h2>Consider Funding Options</h2>
<p>As you map out your growth strategy for 2017, consider whether or not that growth can be achieved organically. Having available financing, even if you do not need it right now, can fuel faster growth and be a buffer when business slows down. Do some research on different forms of funding—whether it’s a traditional line of credit, asset-based lending or same-day funding through <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com"">factoring</a>—and decide what is the best fit for your business.</p>

267,0,Blog Posts,How Good Credit Information Can Help Your Trucking Company ,How Good Credit Information Can Help Your Trucking Company ,"<p>As a business owner, you understand how having a strong credit score can improve your chances at securing funding at affordable rates and attracting new customers.</p>
<p>Gaining access to <a href=""http://www.rtscredit.com"">solid credit data about other companies</a> can be just as crucial to your success. In fact, having this kind of analysis at your fingertips will help you find more reliable customers and business partners, while avoiding some regrettable decisions.</p>
<p>Many financial services companies offer their clients free access to credit information. However, the quality and accuracy of that data can vary greatly. Below are six questions that can help you find the right credit service provider for your trucking fleet:</p>
<h2>What kinds of companies are covered?</h2>
<p>If you operate a trucking business, you’re probably most interested in credit information on freight brokers and companies that ship freight. The credit service provider you select becomes more valuable if it has information on many entities—look for one that follows tens of thousands of companies.</p>
<h2>How up-to-date is the information?</h2>
<p>Credit scores and other information are not helpful if they are not updated regularly. You need a credit service that provides daily or weekly updates, as well as immediate alerts on credit rating downgrades.</p>
<h2>How in-depth is the analysis?</h2>
<p>Ask a credit service agency to show you a sample credit report that includes all the information they share about a company. Ideally, this information should include a credit rating, average days-to-pay, surety bond and trust information and whether the company has an active Department of Transportation authority.</p>
<h2>How is the credit rating calculated?</h2>
<p>Seek a provider that gets its credit information from a wide variety of sources, including other business credit services, government agencies, business and bank references, public SEC filings and other financial statements. If a credit agency draws from numerous sources, its scoring system will be more accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Is the data accessible and easy to understand?</h2>
<p>You should not have to be a financial expert to read a credit report. Look for a credit service provider with a rating system that is simple and easy to understand, while providing the key information you need to make an informed business decision. For example, some providers offer a letter-grading system (“A” to “F”) that any customer can quickly understand and interpret.</p>
<h2>Is the credit service provider independent or part of another business?</h2>
<p>Choosing a provider that is the credit arm of a larger business entity can work to your advantage. It can make the credit service more affordable or even free if you are a client of the affiliated business. The relationship may also include free customer collections and other back-office services for your company. Additionally, the credit service provider may have better data if it has access to financial information that the larger company collects from its own customers and business partners.</p>

268,0,Blog Posts,5 Things to Watch Out For When Choosing a Factoring Company,5 Things to Watch Out For When Choosing a Factoring Company,"<h2>Hidden Fees</h2>

<p>Make sure you understand a factoring company's fee structure. Beware of ""hidden"" fees that cover money transfers, software, collateral and other business costs. Ask if the factor charges only a flat fee, which is a percentage of your total invoice value. Be prepared to negotiate the removal of these fees if they exist or choose a factoring company that doesn’t charge them.</p>

<h2>Bad Customer Service</h2>

<p>Exemplary customer service should be an important part of your factoring experience and lousy customer service is a leading reason why companies leave their factoring provider. When talking with a factoring company, ask if there are dedicated reps to manage and answer questions specifically about your account. You want to know that you’ll be able to reach someone who can help you if you need it. A company’s reviews (like those on Google) may be a helpful resource in determining what kind of customer service they offer.</p>

<h2>Limited Funding </h2>

<p>Before entering into a factoring agreement, make sure the factor has enough financial resources to continue funding your invoices even as your company and receivables grow. Factoring companies that have been in business and have served your industry for several years usually have greater financial capacity. Watch out for newer companies that might not have the access to the resources needed to fund your invoices as you grow and take on more customers of your own.</p>

<h2>No Online Account Access </h2>

<p>Some factoring companies make it difficult for you to see your account information. Make sure you can access your account balance, aging and reserve reports online. This is critical information you need to run your business effectively. Look for a company that offers a mobile solution, so you can submit invoices from anywhere at any time. A factoring company that requires you to email or mail in invoice documents might mean they are lacking the technology that makes the entire factoring process much easier on you.</p>

<h2>Bad Application Process</h2>

<p>Things like a lengthy application process, taking forever to approve a new customer or filing the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) too early can have a negative impact on your business. For example, if a factoring company files the UCC too early and you decide to do business with another factor, the existing UCC must first be terminated. If you are shopping around for factoring companies, you want to make sure you know what to expect so you aren’t blindsided in the final stages of the deal.</p>

270,0,Blog Posts,How Factoring Helps Oilfield Services Companies Meet Increased Demands,How Factoring Helps Oilfield Services Companies Meet Increased Demands,"<p>After a two-year hiatus, the oilfield services industry appears to be on the rebound.</p>

<p>While U.S. oil production has not yet returned to its pre-2015 levels, the number of oil rigs that have been put back to work has steadily increased in recent months. According to Baker Hughes, 741 oil and gas rigs were operating across the country in early February, up nearly 11% from the previous month and 36% higher than in February 2016.</p>

<p>The shale oil industry got a big boost late last year with the discovery of the largest shale deposit in the United States. Located in the oil-rich Permian Basin in Texas, the deposit is estimated to be worth $900 billion. More good news arrived last month in the form of President Donald Trump, who approved construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines.</p>

<p>In short, the future looks bright again for the domestic oil industry.</p>

<img src=""/sites/default/files/oil-boom-infographic.jpg"" />


<h2>Get Ready to Grow</h2>

<p>Thanks to your hard work and resourcefulness, your oilfield services business survived the oil slump of 2015-16. Now, you may be seeing an increase in demand. Expect more growth in the coming months. As the rig count continues to grow nationwide, there will be more opportunities for sand and water haulers, construction companies, hot shots, roustabouts and other companies that serve the oil patch.</p>

<p>Ramping up to meet growing demand is a good thing, but it also comes with its share of headaches. First and foremost, you need strong cash flow to support the addition of workers, drivers, trucks and equipment. Cash may be hard to come by while waiting up to 60 days on customer payments. You also probably don’t have time to apply for and secure a bank loan or other traditional lines of credit.</p>

<h2>Factoring Can Help</h2>

<p>Factoring invoices may be the easiest way for your company to quickly build the working capital needed to serve your customers and support your growth.</p>

<p>Industry trends show that drilling companies usually take 45 to 60 days to pay their vendors. That payment cycle can deplete your company’s cash flow and limit your ability to add people, equipment and services to meet increased customer demand. The immediate cash generated from factoring can support spikes in demand and ensure you don’t have to turn down new business due to a shortage of working capital.</p>

<p>The funding through factoring also grows as your receivables grow. The quick cash flow provided by factoring matches your oilfield services company’s needs, whether you are in a down market or seeing a significant increase in new business.</p>

272,0,Blog Posts,"Factoring Helps Firearms Companies Boost Cash Flow, Meet Customer Demands","Factoring Helps Firearms Companies Boost Cash Flow, Meet Customer Demands","<p>If your company is involved in the manufacturing and distribution of firearms or ammunition, you understand the pressure to meet growing customer demands.</p>
<p>The past two years have seen record sales for the firearm industry in the United States. According to FBI data, there were more than 23 million background checks for gun purchases in 2015. Last year, the number of background checks increased to 27 million. Manufacturers like Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger are seeing record sales, as are major firearm retailers like Walmart, Cabela’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods.</p>
<p>While business may be booming for makers, suppliers and distributors in the firearm industry, keeping up with surging demand from American consumers can be very challenging. Increased production costs can quickly deplete your company’s available cash and limit your ability to grow.</p>
<h2>Have Your Considered Factoring?</h2>
<p>Many firearms manufacturers are learning that factoring receivables is the most effective way to immediately increase their cash flow.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting 30 to 60 days to receive payment from Walmart or another retail customer, your company can factor the invoice and receive a cash advance in less than 24 hours. This funding allows you to pay vendors more quickly, increase production, speed up your supply chain and add new business. Unlike a traditional bank loan, factoring grows as your company’s receivables grow and is also debt-free.</p>
<h2>How Factoring Works in Five Steps:</h2>
<p>1. You deliver your product to a customer.</p>
<p>2. You send the invoice to a factoring company, also known as a “factor.” The factor sends the invoice to your customer.</p>
<p>3. The factor advances your company 80% or more of the invoice value.</p>
<p>4. Your customer pays the factor the full value of the invoice. The factor pays you the reserve balance, minus a fee.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Factoring</h2>
<p>In addition to same-day funding of your invoices, here are some other ways factoring can benefit your firearms business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most factors provide free back-office support, including managing collections from your customers. This gives you more time and resources to focus on growing your company.</li>
<li>Factoring is based on the quality of your customers’ credit, not your own credit or business history.</li>
<li>Factoring can be customized and managed so that it provides necessary capital when your company needs it.</li>
<li>Factoring is not a loan, so you do not incur debt when you factor.</li>
<li>Factoring is scalable, meaning the amount of funding can grow as your receivables grow.</li>
</ul>

280,0,Blog Posts,How to Find the Right Dispatch Software for Your Trucking Company ,How to Find the Right Dispatch Software for Your Trucking Company ,"<p>If your trucking company operates more than a handful of power units, it is time for you to consider using a software technology to help manage your fleet.</p>
<p>Dispatch software offers several advantages to small- and mid-sized trucking fleets. Not only can the software create efficiencies and improve load profitability, it provides the visibility to trucks that is now demanded by many shippers and freight brokers.</p>
<p>Dispatch software’s detailed reporting also helps fleets stay compliant with a growing number of government regulations. On Dec. 18, the U.S. DOT will require most heavy trucks to track drivers’ hours-of-service with electronic logging devices (ELDs). For many trucking companies, a dispatch software system will make it easier to align fleet scheduling with the ELD data and drivers’ availability.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of dispatch software products on the market today for trucking companies. The cost, quality and capabilities of these products can differ significantly.</p>
<p>Below are some things to consider as you seek the right software product for your fleet:</p>
<h2>Ease of Use</h2>
<p>Dispatch software products vary greatly in terms of their layout and user experience. You need software that makes it easy to spot truck locations, driver availability and trip scheduling. You also want a system that allows you to quickly enter and retrieve orders.</p>
<p>Some software products provide color-coded dispatch boards that allow you to check your fleet’s status at a glance. The screen should be easy to navigate when pulling up orders or contact information. When shopping for software, take time to go through a free demo to ensure that the product is intuitive and easy for you and your team to use.</p>
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>How well does the software sync up with your accounting and other systems? Since many trucking companies do their accounting on QuickBooks, finding a dispatch software platform that easily integrates with QuickBooks could be essential. Other dispatch software products also provide their own accounting modules that allow you to track your fleet’s payables and invoices.</p>
<p>Depending on the size and complexity of your trucking business, you might consider software that links up with specialized systems. These may include an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, transportation management software (TMS) or a web map service.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>As with any potential business partner, the experience and industry knowledge of a software provider are important. How long has the company been in business, and how long has it served the trucking industry? Some of the best dispatch software products on the market today were created by trucking professionals who understand how to manage a fleet. A software product with that kind of industry insight could be easier to use and more beneficial to your company.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Data</h2>
<p>You want dispatch software that is reliable and provides real-time visibility to your fleet. Before investing in a product, learn how the software collects information and what kind of data it uses. Does the product rely on just one or multiple satellite providers to track and trace your trucks? Does it allow you to create end-of-day reports and crunch other data that is accurate and up-to-date?</p>
<p>A dispatch software program is only as good as the information it provides. Make sure you know the ins and outs of how your software compiles data.</p>
<h2>Versatility</h2>
<p>Some dispatch software companies market themselves as all-in-one providers that perform multiple fleet functions. In addition to dispatch, these functions can include accounting, IFTA reporting, truck maintenance, DOT safety compliance and more. Small- and medium-sized trucking fleets can benefit from a software solution that performs several tasks, helping to reduce headcount and administrative costs.</p>
<h2>Affordability</h2>
<p>Pricing can vary greatly for different forms of dispatch software. Some products can cost just a few dollars a month, but may lack the scalability and functionality your fleet needs as it grows. Take time to shop around for a product with the capabilities you need and a pricing structure that is within your budget.</p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Look for software that is a good fit for the way your trucking company operates. Is it important to have smartphone and Cloud-based accessibility? Could your drivers and dispatch team benefit from a platform that allows for two-way texting? It is also important to know early on how many of your employees and drivers need “seats” to access the software. Adding more users to the software will likely cost your company more money.</p>
<h2>Cost Savings</h2>
<p>The key selling points of dispatch software are that it makes your trucking company more efficient and, ultimately, will save you money. How much you save depends on how well you understand your company’s current and future needs.</p>
<p>Before entering an agreement with a software provider, assess the costs and “pain points” of operating your fleet. Is your company growing too fast for your dispatch teem to keep pace? What is your rate of on-time deliveries and what does it cost—in terms of people, time and paperwork—to maintain that performance? Will switching to ELDs in the next year or so dramatically change the way you do business?</p>
<p>Once you understand your operational needs, you will improve your chances of finding a dispatch software product that addresses those needs and should eventually save you money.</p>

<p>The IRS allows you to deduct 50% of the access fees you pay for the phones and other mobile devices you use in running your business.</p>

<h3>ATM, Bank and Credit Card Fees</h3>

<p>As with the other deductibles listed, you can only write off transaction fees you incur when conducting business.</p>

<h3>Satellite Radio</h3>

<p>Because truck drivers often use satellite radio for weather and traffic information, the cost of a subscription can be deducted from your taxes.</p>

<h3>Truck Maintenance Costs</h3>

<p>Expenses associated with truck maintenance and cleaning can be deducted. If you do your own repairs, you can deduct the cost of parts, but not for labor.</p>

<h3>Fuel</h3>

<p>Out-of-pocket fuel costs and fuel card fees can be deducted.</p>

<h3>Licenses, Permits and other Government Fees</h3>

<p>Half of your self-employment tax is deductible. You cannot deduct the cost of speeding tickets, weight violations or other penalties paid to the government.</p>

<h3>Per Diem Costs</h3>

<p>The IRS allows you to deduct a per diem cost of meals, lodging and other expenses while you are on the road. It is usually around $63.00 per day. This deduction may be more convenient than saving all your receipts. If you are a self-employed driver working for a carrier, you can only deduct the traveling expenses you incur that are not reimbursed by the carrier.</p>

<h3>Uniform and Laundry</h3>

<p>If you work for a carrier that requires you to wear a company uniform, you can deduct it on your tax return. The costs of doing laundry while you are on the road are also tax-deductible.</p>

<h3>Retirement Plans</h3>

<p>These include contributions to retirement plans like an IRA or a Keogh plan for yourself or your spouse.</p>

<h3>Insurance Premiums</h3>

<p>Your deductions can include premiums paid on company and personal insurance plans.</p>

<h3>Truck Lease</h3>

<p>Under a lease-purchase agreement, 100% of your truck payments are deductible. Your security deposit is not deductible.</p>

<h2>What is a BOC-3?</h2>

<p>Form BOC-3 (Designation of Agents for Service of Process) gives motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders a legal presence in any state where they do business.</p>

<p>By filing the BOC-3, which stands for blanket of coverage, a trucking company designates the process agents that represent them in every state their trucks haul freight. The designated process agent will accept court papers from the state on behalf of the trucking company should there ever be a legal issue.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say Kevin’s Trucking is a company based out of Kansas. One of their trucks is involved in an accident while hauling goods in Oklahoma. Another driver involved in the crash decides to take legal action. The BOC-3 form for Kevin’s Trucking authorizes a process agent in Oklahoma to physically receive court documents related to that lawsuit.</p>

<h2><strong>Filing a BOC-3</strong></h2>

<p>The FMCSA requires that a process agent files the BOC-3 on behalf of a motor carrier. Brokers and freight forwarders that do not operate any of their own commercial motor vehicles can file the Form BOC-3 on their own.</p>

<p>Only one completed form may be on file with the FMCSA. It must include all states for which agency designations are required. The cost of filing an initial BOC-3 typically ranges from $20 to $40.</p>

<p>One signed copy of the BOC-3 form should be filed with each state in which a trucking company operates. That company should also have a copy of the BOC-3 at their primary office. Any changes to designated agents will require the filing of a new BOC-3 with the FMCSA and with the related states.</p>

<h2><strong>Designating a Process Agent</strong></h2>

<p>All motor carriers are required to appoint a process agent for each state in which they operate, including any states they pass through. Brokers and freight forwarders are required to appoint a process agent in each state in which they have an office and in which they write contracts.</p>

<p>Process agents that provide nationwide coverage are typically referred to as blanket companies. Many trucking companies choose a blanket company to save time and eliminate the need to find individual agents for multiple states.</p>

<p>Each person or company that is designated for a specific state must reside in that state. A carrier, broker or freight forwarder may designate themselves for the state in which they reside. It is important to note that a post office box is not acceptable as an agent’s address.</p>

<p>Once an application for motor carrier and U.S. DOT numbers is posted by the FMCSA, the company’s contact information becomes public. It is likely they will receive a lot of phone calls from companies saying they specialize in BOC-3s and other permits. It is important to make sure an individual or company acting as a process agent is in fact authorized to file BOC-3 forms and can provide coverage in every state needed. To help alleviate this concern, first check the FMCSA list of <strong><a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/process-agents"">registered process agents</a></strong>.</p>

285,0,Blog Posts,How to Prepare Your Trucking Company for the ELD Mandate,How to Prepare Your Trucking Company for the ELD Mandate,"<p>On Dec. 18, 2017, a controversial federal rule took effect requiring most commercial trucks to be equipped with electronic logging devices, also known as ELDs.</p>
<p>Many trucking groups spoke out against the ELD mandate after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) authorized it in 2015. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association challenged the rule in federal court. Still, the mandate moved forward, requiring most trucking companies to begin using ELDs to log hours of service.</p>
<p>If your company is new to electronic logging devices, below is some valuable information on how to prepare your trucks for the upcoming rule:</p>
<h2>Know How the Law Affects Your Company</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that not every carrier will have to install ELDs. The mandate does not apply to any heavy trucks that are older than the model year 2000. Some other exceptions include regional carriers that operate within 100 miles of their terminals and tow-away companies that haul new or used vehicles. If your company currently uses the old automatic onboard recording devices (AORDs), you get an extra two years, until Dec. 16, 2019, before you must start using ELDs.</p>
<p>Before investing time and money on logging devices, <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices-and-hours-service-supporting-documents"">study the ELD rule carefully.</a> Your company may not have to comply.</p>
<h2>Start Planning</h2>
<p>If you do need to start using ELDs, now is the time to begin anticipating how logging drivers’ hours electronically will affect your fleet and your customers. How much should you budget to purchase the technology, and what ELD product should you select? Before doing anything, check out the FMCSA's <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/eld-manufacturers"">online registry of certified ELD manufacturers.</a> You do not want to adopt a technology that does not meet the specifications of the new rule.</p>
<p>After familiarizing yourself with a few ELD products, do some research on the electronic logging market. The entrance of several new providers should bring the average price of an ELD system down. Make sure you get a good deal on technology that is compliant and fits well with your operations.</p>
<h2>Stay Informed</h2>
<p>A few new wrinkles have been added to the ELD rule since announcing that it would go into effect. There may be more changes to come. For example, the FMCSA has issued exemptions and waivers on ELD compliance for livestock haulers and other specialized carriers since the mandate took effect.</p>
<p>There may be other exemptions to the ELD rule. Read up on industry news about ELDs to ensure that your trucking company is prepared.</p>
<h2>Keep Customers Updated</h2>
<p>Shippers are also concerned about ELDs and how the new regulation will affect their supply chains. Communicate with your customers about how and when your trucks will follow the mandate. Ask for their help in making sure that detention time at pick-up or delivery has minimal impact on your drivers’ hours. Being open and proactive about the rule will reassure your shippers that you have a plan of action and that everything is under control.</p>
<h2>Prepare for a Dip</h2>
<p>Trucking companies that begin logging hours electronically often report a temporary decline in fleet productivity. Both drivers and dispatchers need to be trained on the new system, and there may be some interruptions to service.</p>
<p>During the learning curve, do what you can to expedite shipping and receiving. Also, make sure your company <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/product/factoring-services"">has enough cash on hand</a> to get through the dip in productivity.</p>
<p>The good news is that business bounces back for many trucking companies that successfully adopt ELDs. You might even see an increase in load rates later this year as capacity tightens and the trucking industry scrambles to meet the requirements of the new law.</p>

290,0,Blog Posts,Seven Keys to Great Customer Service,Seven Keys to Great Customer Service,"<p>Over 50 years, Stanley Marcus turned a little-known Dallas specialty store called Neiman Marcus into one of the world’s most prestigious retailers of luxury goods.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Marcus"">Marcus was a brilliant marketer and merchandiser</a>, but he credited most of his success to great service. Neiman Marcus beat out other retailers not because it had better products, but because it treated its customers better.</p>
<p>“The dollar bills the customer gets from tellers in four banks are the same,” Marcus once said. “What is different are the tellers.”</p>
<p>Providing good, consistent customer service is difficult, but it may be your company’s best shot at gaining an edge over competitors.</p>
<p>Below are seven ways you can take your customer service to a higher level. If your employees faithfully practice these steps, you’ll seen an increase in sales and customer loyalty.</p>
<h2>Always Pick Up the Phone</h2>
<p>Nobody likes going to voicemail and waiting on a return call, particularly if they have an urgent issue. Always picking up the phone during business hours is a simple way you can stand out among your competitors. Customers and prospects will appreciate your team’s accessibility.</p>
<h2>Build a Culture of Service</h2>
<p>Recruit and hire people who understand the importance of putting customers ahead of their own interests. Preach the importance of building long-term relationships with clients and how that can generate positive word-of-mouth about your company. Become an example to your employees of how to be accountable and treat people the right way. As Walt Disney once said, “Do what you do so well that (customers) will want to see it again, and bring their friends.”</p>
<h2>Be Available 24/7</h2>
<p>Information technology and the speed of business today mean that service providers should be accessible to their customers any day at any time. If possible, designate an account manager to each one of your customers. Let your customers know they have a single point-of-contact who can address their needs at any time.</p>
<h2>Communicate Effectively</h2>
<p>Whether it’s your payment terms, new services or personnel changes, keep your customers in the loop about what’s happening at your company. Devise a strategy to stay in regular communication, whether it’s through periodic phone calls, email campaigns or social media. Clear, consistent communication is key to retaining customers, understanding their pain points and providing solutions when you can.</p>
<h2>Treat Your Customers Like Human Beings</h2>
<p>Chic-fil-A is the most profitable fast-food restaurant chain in the country right now. One key reason? The company <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-is-the-most-polite-chain-2016-10"">teaches employees to always say “please” and “thank you.”</a> Sadly, good manners are such a rarity in some industries that they can now be considered a strategic advantage. Always treat your customers with respect and courtesy. It’s the right thing to do and they will appreciate it.</p>
<h2>Treat Your Business Partners Like Customers</h2>
<p>Most companies rely on vendors, suppliers or strategic partners to help deliver a product or service. These relationships can be as crucial to your success as your client relationships. Maintain a strong line of communication with your business partners and let them know they are valued. Building friendships with other companies you do business with can help smooth out disagreements or challenges that may arise during the partnership.</p>
<h2>Back Up Your Guarantee</h2>
<p>All businesses promise to treat their customers right. Not all of them deliver on that promise. The fact is, providing good, consistent service is hard. Just one missed call or oversight can have disastrous results. As Warren Buffett has said, “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.”</p>
<p>No company or process is perfect. Mistakes happen. How you respond to those mistakes and make things right with your customers speaks volumes about your company’s values and credibility. Being accountable, doing the right thing even when it means a temporary loss, will be noticed by your customers and employees. They will appreciate that integrity, and will pay you back with loyalty and great word-of-mouth.</p>

291,0,Blog Posts,What Trump’s Energy Plan Could Mean for Oilfield Services ,What Trump’s Energy Plan Could Mean for Oilfield Services ,"<p>One of Donald J. Trump’s priorities as president has been to lower energy costs for Americans and create more jobs in the energy sector. <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy"">Trump’s America First Energy Plan </a> pledges to increase wages by more than $30 billion in seven years by casting aside Obama-era regulations and increasing oil, gas and coal production.</p>
<p>Trump has already signed two executive orders that could eventually have a big impact on the oil and gas industry. In January, he reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, controversial projects that had been blocked or delayed under President Obama. In April, Trump signed an order allowing for energy exploration and offshore drilling along U.S. coastlines.</p>
<p>Both orders set the stage for more crude oil production, but it may be years before they become game-changers for oilfield services companies. Here are the reasons why:</p>
<h2>Oil Prices are Low</h2>
<p>Today, the price of crude oil hovers around $49 a barrel. Oil prices are up from a year ago, but still down significantly from 2014, when oil topped $100 a barrel. While the U.S. rig count has started to increase again, the oil & gas industry is still recovering from a crash that led to many bankruptcies and the loss of over 200,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Currently, a glut of domestically produced oil has helped keep prices low. Until that inventory decreases and prices rise, oil companies will have little incentive to spend money on more exploration and production.</p>
<h2>Regulations are Not the Main Issue</h2>
<p>While oil companies have applauded Trump’s efforts to slash federal regulations, market forces are a much bigger factor than government oversight. Industry experts say that swings in the price of oil far outweigh the few dollars per barrel of costs related to environmental regulations.</p>
<p>“Regulation is a hassle. It’s a secondary factor at best,” said Mike Wittner, global head of oil research at Societe Generale, <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/27/investing/trump-oil-coal-energy-plan/"">in a recent interview with CNNMoney.</a></p>
<h2>Offshore Drilling Takes Time</h2>
<p>Even with Trump’s order to open U.S. coastlines to more offshore drilling, it will take several years to build more drilling sites. The exploration of deep sea oil reserves is expensive and complex. Securing oil leases from the federal government to drill offshore can take years. Finally, there will be legal challenges from environment groups and states that are concerned about the impact on tourism. At this point, oil producers may be reluctant to spend the time and money on offshore exploration.</p>
<h2>Demand is Currently Being Met</h2>
<p>Trump has taken steps to open more federal lands to drilling. However, the energy sector is currently focused on pumping oil from private land in shale hotbeds like the Bakken Formation in North Dakota and the Permian Basin in Texas. The opening of the Dakota Access Pipeline will unleash crude oil that has been trapped in the Bakken shale play.</p>
<p>Future growth in oil production is likely to come from shale in Texas and North Dakota, but market conditions indicate that oil demand in the U.S. and overseas is currently being met. The opening of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama blocked and Trump has now approved, may be further delayed due to a lack of intertest from oil producers in North Dakota and Montana.</p>

Finding affordable boards that consistently generate well-paying loads for your company may require some time and research.</p>

<p>You can start by becoming familiar with the five freight-matching services that dominate the crowded digital load board market. What follows are summaries on the services, pricing and accessibility of each of these load board giants.</p>



<!--
<h2>DAT</h2>

<p>By far the biggest and oldest truck load board provider, <a href=""http://www.dat.com/load-board"">DAT Solutions</a> operates three popular freight-matching platforms: DAT Power, DAT Express and DAT TruckersEdge. Earlier this year, DAT expanded its presence by merging with <a href=""http://www.getloaded.com/"">GetLoaded</a>, another leading load board. Combined, the DAT boards post an average of more than 485,000 loads each business day and have a database of more than 1.3 million trucks.</p>

<p>DAT Power is a live load board, allowing you to view loads, trucks and transactions in real time. The board provides data on truckload rates based on actual transactions, not bids, across 65,000 lanes. DAT Power also has a payment guarantee that covers payments of up to $1,000 per load.</p>

<p>DAT Express is geared toward smaller brokerages and growing fleets, and allows for unlimited load searches and truck postings. The board provides alerts when new posts match your search, and suggests triangular routes that help you eliminate dead-head miles. DAT TruckersEdge provides small carriers and owner-operators with access to North America’s largest marketplace for freight loads and trucks. The board incudes average rates paid on specific lanes, as well as credit and days-to-pay data on thousands of brokers.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>

<p>DAT Power, which features the most state-of-the-art freight-matching technology, starts at $149 per month. DAT Express costs $109 monthly for the broker package, and $99 for carriers.

306,0,Blog Posts,A Great Way to Save Money and Prepare for the ELD Mandate,A Great Way to Save Money and Prepare for the ELD Mandate,"<p>Despite legal hurdles and proposed bills in Congress, the federal rule requiring most commercial trucks to use electronic logging devices will likely take effect on Dec. 18, 2017.</p>
<p>Not all trucking companies have to comply, but most carriers hauling interstate freight <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/how-prepare-your-trucking-company-eld-mandate"">will need to start using ELDs before year's end</a>.

308,0,Blog Posts,How to Get a Secured Business Line of Credit,How to Get a Secured Business Line of Credit,"<p>During the ups and downs of owning a business, there are times when you will need a reliable way to build more cash flow. One solution is to have a secured small business line of credit from a bank.</p>
<p>What is a secured business line of credit? It’s a flexible, revolving credit line that provides your business with working capital when you need it. When you don’t need to use the credit line, in most cases you don’t have to pay for it. Unlike an unsecured business line of credit, which many banks also offer, the secured line of credit provides access to more cash to address longer-term business needs.</p>
<p>A secured business line of credit can be a valuable financial tool, but getting one requires some preparation and commitment. Below are steps you should take in order to land the best credit line for your business:</p>
<h2>Know Why You Need the Credit</h2>
<p>This seems like a no-brainer, but give careful thought to why your company needs a secured business line of credit and whether that is the best financial instrument for you to use. Do you need the capital to get through a down cycle, or to expand your company? Do you need the cash immediately, or are you planning for future growth down the road?</p>
<p>The advantage of a secured line of credit is that it can provide access to hundreds of thousands of dollars in working capital through checks or company credit cards. However, you will need to “secure” that credit line with collateral like a blanket lien on general business assets or a certificate of deposit. Before you pursue this kind of financing, you’ll want to plan on how to use the money and how much you are willing to commit to secure it.</p>
<h2>Have a Cash Flow Projection</h2>
<p>Building <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-cash-flow-budget-and-why-do-you-need-one"">a cash flow budget or forecast</a> allows you to run your business more effectively and pinpoint times when you need an injection of cash. Doing this kind of disciplined analysis up-front will help identify how big a line of credit you should pursue and when you will need access to that cash.</p>
<h2>Know If You Qualify for a Secured Line of Credit</h2>
<p>Different banks have different requirements for extending lines of credit. You stand a better chance of being approved for a secured line of credit if you have been in business at least two years and have annual revenue of more than $200,000. Your personal credit score also typically needs to be 650 or higher.</p>
<h2>Get Company and Personal Financials in Order</h2>
<p>To apply for a secured line of credit, you will need to provide a bank with some basic business and personal information. These items may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long you have been in business</li>
<li>Bank account information</li>
<li>Tax records</li>
<li>Personal information on all business owners</li>
<li>Number of employees</li>
<li>Net profit and gross revenue</li>
<li>Any outstanding debts and obligations</li>
<li>What expenses, equipment or real estate you plan to finance with the credit line</li>
</ul>
<h2>Define Your Terms</h2>
<p>Before applying for a line of credit, have a specific interest rate in mind, as well as how much in collateral you are willing to commit. The interest rate on your secured line of credit will depend on your creditworthiness, the line amount and your company’s relationship with the bank. Just because a bank advertises “rates as low as 4.75%” does not mean you will get that rate, as that number depends on many different factors.</p>
<p>As with any important business relationship, you should shop around for the best partner. Different banks have different policies on rates, how much credit they will extend and what equity or collateral they require from a client.</p>
<h2>Be Prepared to Wait</h2>
<p>A secured business line of credit can be a difficult credit line to obtain, depending on your company’s history and creditworthiness. The process could take anywhere from three weeks to 60 days, as a bank builds a term sheet and runs your credit line past its underwriting committee. During this period, the deal could be amended or rejected at any time. As a result, the secured line of credit may not be the best option if your company needs quick access to cash. Other forms of financing like asset-based lending or <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-factoring"">factoring</a> may be better, more immediate solutions.</p>

317,0,Blog Posts,What is Purchase Order Financing? ,What is Purchase Order Financing? ,"<p>Purchase order financing is a form of short-term funding that provides the cash companies need to pay their suppliers up-front for a customer order.</p>
<p>Also sometimes called “P.O. financing,” the advance funding of purchase orders is an effective tool for business owners who don’t want to turn down a customer request because they lack the cash to fulfill it. Purchase order financing enables companies to handle big orders, enhance customer and supplier relationships, and improve their order volume.</p>
<h2>How Purchase Order Financing Works</h2>
<p>When you enter a purchase order financing arrangement, four parties are involved—your business, your supplier, your customer and a purchase order financing company.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how it works:</p>
<p>1. Your company receives an order from a customer.</p>
<p>2. The purchase order financing company pays your supplier for goods that must be purchased to complete the order.</p>
<p>3. The purchase order financing company collects payment from your customer.</p>
<p>4. The purchase order financing company pays your company the customer invoice amount, minus fees.</p>
<h2>How is Purchase Order Financing Different from Factoring?</h2>
<p>Companies that use purchase order financing have a different cash flow need than those that use factoring.</p>
<p>Factoring clients need funding to keep cash coming in <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-factoring"">during the 30- to 60-day period between when they complete and job and the customer pays</a>. Companies that use purchase order financing need cash up front in order to complete work for a client.</p>
<p>In short, factoring funds the customer invoice, while purchase order financing funds the customer order.</p>
<p>In many cases, purchase order financing clients may only need to fund a portion of the expense of fulfilling a large customer order. However, 100% financing also available on purchase orders.</p>
<h2>Who Uses Purchase Order Financing?</h2>
<p>A wide variety of businesses turn to purchase order financing to address needs like tight cash flow, growth plans or seasonal customer demand. Companies that finance their purchase orders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start-up businesses</li>
<li>Wholesalers</li>
<li>Distributors</li>
<li>Manufacturers</li>
<li>Government contactors</li>
<li>Import/export companies</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Qualify for Funding</h2>
<p>It is easier for companies to finance their purchase orders than to receive a bank loan or line of credit. As with factoring, purchase order financing providers are more concerned about the creditworthiness of a client’s customers than that of the client itself. Also like factoring, the funding provided by purchase order financing is not a loan. The client assumes no debt.</p>
<p>The costs associated with purchase order financing can vary for each transaction. The purchase order financing provider’s underwriting standards, as well as the credit risk of the customer involved, help determine the fees. The cost of financing typically ranges between 1.5% to 6% of the value of the purchase orders funded per month.</p>

321,321,Blog Posts,How is Factoring Different Than Asset-Based Lending?,How is Factoring Different Than Asset-Based Lending?,"<p>The factoring of accounts receivable and asset-based lending are sometimes confused as one and the same. However, they are two very different forms of financing.</p>
<p>While factoring is asset-based, it is structured differently from asset-based lending, providing different risks, costs and benefits to the customer.</p>
<p>What follows is an explanation of factoring and asset-based lending, and what makes these two financing models different from each other.</p>
<h2>How Factoring Works</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-factoring"">Factoring </a>is a financial transaction in which a company sells its accounts receivable to a third-party factoring company in exchange for quick payment. The company benefits because it receives 90% or more of an invoice value within a day instead of waiting two to three months on a customer payment. The factoring provider then collects payment on the invoice from the customer and pays the balance to the company, minus a factoring fee.</p>
<h2>How Asset-Based Lending Works</h2>
<p>Asset-based lending is a loan or a revolving line of credit that is secured using a company’s assets as collateral. Like factoring, asset-based lending can use receivables as collateral, but it can also extend to other assets like equipment, real estate, inventory and raw materials.</p>
<p>The amount of money a company can borrow through asset-based lending depends on the value of the assets that are put up as collateral. Asset-based loans provide a loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which can be between 75% and 90% for receivables, but often 50% or less on other collateral. If the value of your company’s assets changes, that will affect how much money you are able to borrow through an asset-based loan.</p>
<h2>Factoring vs. Asset-Based Lending</h2>
<p><strong>Factoring is Faster</strong></p>
<p>The approval process for factoring generally involves reviewing the credit ratings of your company and your customers, which only takes a few days. To qualify for an asset-based loan, however, the value of the assets that will be used as collateral need to be verified. This can take the lender several days or even weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Asset-Based Lending is More Private</strong></p>
<p>Before you enter into a factoring agreement, the factor must contact your customers to verify their accounts with your company. The factor will remain in contact with your customers since it will be handing collections on the invoices. That means your clients will learn that you are using factoring as a way to fund your business.</p>
<p>Asset-based lending is more private, as there is little interaction between the lender and your customers—that is, unless you are using accounts receivable as collateral.</p>
<p><strong>Factoring Takes on More Risk</strong></p>
<p>Factoring providers are generally more likely to extend funding to small or start-up companies that often do not qualify for traditional bank financing. Asset-based loans, however, are designed for larger, more established companies that have significant assets and are well on their way to becoming “bankable.”</p>
<p><strong>Factoring Can be More Flexible</strong></p>
<p>Factoring is a sales transaction, not a loan. There are no required monthly payments to a lender. The factoring of invoices takes place with each sales transaction, which means that funding from factoring can “scale up” with your company’s growth as your receivables increase.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost Structure is Different</strong></p>
<p>Factoring fees are determined as a percentage of an invoice value—usually between 1.5% and 3.5% for each receivable. Asset-based loans are priced with an annual percentage rate (APR), often ranging between 7% and 15%.</p>

322,0,Blog Posts,What is a Cash Flow Statement? ,What is a Cash Flow Statement? ,"<p>The cash flow statement, which is also sometimes called a statement of cash flow, is a financial document that reports how much money your company is spending and how much money you have available at a given time.</p>

<p>The cash flow statement joins the balance sheet and the income statement as the three primary documents that reflect your company’s financial condition. The balance sheet outlines your company’s assets and debts. The income statement is an overview of incoming revenue and expenses. The cash flow statement looks at the cash that is entering and leaving your company through operations, investing and financing.</p>

<p>Cash flow is not the same as the net income that is reported on your balance sheet or income statement. While net income includes sales made on credit, cash flow provides a snapshot of money that has already been collected and spent by your company.</p>

<h2>Why is a Cash Flow Statement Important?</h2>

<p>The cash flow statement is very valuable because it shows how much actual cash your company is generating. This helps you manage day-to-day operations, and provides lenders and potential investors with insight into your company’s financial performance.</p>

<p>Understanding cash flow is critical to making the right decisions for your business. For example, let’s say you need to acquire a new piece of equipment to keep up with customer demands. This asset will mean an additional $500 in monthly expenses. Can you afford it? Your income statement shows a healthy net income for your company, but that includes both cash sales and sales made on credit.</p>

<p>The cash flow statement, however, tells you how much cash your company has on hand right now, helping you to decide how to manage the additional expense of the new equipment.</p>

<h2>What Makes Up a Cash Flow Statement?</h2>

<p>The statement breaks down the inflow and outflow of cash into three key areas: operations, investing and financing.</p>

<p>The operations component reports how much cash is being generated by your products and services. To arrive at your operational cash flow, you need to look at accounts receivable, depreciation, inventory and accounts payable. Remember—your operational cash flow should only reflect completed cash transactions, not income or spending that has been made on credit.</p>

<p>The cash flow from investing activities shows the amount of cash your company has spent or generated on assets like equipment, buildings or monetary investments like marketable securities.</p>

<p>Cash flow from financing includes changes in your company’s debt, loans or dividend payments. Cash flow is coming in from financing activities like capital investment in your company. Cash flow is outgoing when expenses like dividend and loan payments are made.</p>

<h2>Example of a Cash Flow Statement</h2>


<p>The information contained in a cash flow statement can vary depending on a company’s activities and industry. If you have questions on what to include in your company’s cash flow statement, it is a good idea to consult with a certified public accountant.</p>

323,0,Blog Posts,Why Trucking is Still America’s Number One Job,Why Trucking is Still America’s Number One Job,"<p class=""margin-top-0"">Much has been written in recent years about <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/trucking-jobs.html"">the challenges faced by truck drivers</a>  in the United States today. Driving an over-the-road truck can be lonely and isolating. Wages for many truckers have stagnated. There’s a growing number of government rules regulating what drivers can and can’t do on the job.</p> 

<p>Truck driving is tough work. It also remains a very important job. An overwhelming amount of statistics show that trucking may be the leading indicator of the country’s economic health. If trucks are moving more freight, that means Americans are more productive and earning more money.</p> 

<p>Below are seven reasons—backed by recent stats—explaining why trucking is America’s number one job today.</p>

<h2>Truckers are Everywhere</h2>

<p>Despite a much-publicized shortage of qualified drivers, truck driving remains one of the fastest-growing occupations in the United States. There are more than 1.7 million heavy-duty and tractor-trailer truck driving jobs today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Overall, a total of 7.4 million Americans have jobs tied to the trucking industry. A recent study by National Public Radio found that “trucker driver” was the most dominant job in 29 U.S. states, including California and Texas.</p>

<img src=""https://www.rtsfinancial.com/sites/default/files/Trucker%20Jobs%20Map.png"" />

<h2>Trucks Move Everything</h2>

<p>Rail and intermodal transportation have been growing in recent years. However, commercial trucks still move the lion’s share of goods and materials. These statistics from the American Trucking Associations’ 2017 <em>Trends</em> report illustrate the industry’s dominance.</p>

<h2>Driving Isn’t Automated</h2>

<p>At a time when many American blue-collar jobs in have been in decline, the number of truck driving jobs has grown. That is because trucking has been immune to two of the biggest forces affecting the U.S. workforce today—automation and offshoring.</p>

<p>Driving a truck over the Interstate cannot be outsourced to India or China. Likewise, robots have not learned how to drive and park a rig. That latter fact may not always remain true, as truck manufacturers are attempting to develop trucks with self-driving technologies.</p>

<h2>Trucking Drives the Economy (and Vice-Versa)</h2>

<p>Many economists look to trucking as a key bell weather of the United States’ overall economic health. When more trucks are moving and freight rates are rising, that means consumers are spending more, and retailers and manufacturers are adding to their inventories. It’s no coincidence that, at a time when consumer confidence and overall employment are at the highest levels in nearly 17 years, the trucking industry is also seeing growth in shipping demand.</p>

<h2>Trucking is Small Business</h2>

<p>Is the American dream dead? Not with trucking, apparently. Owning and operating a single truck or a small fleet remains the most frequent route to business ownership. In fact, trucking is an industry made up of small businesses, with 91% of motor carriers operating six or fewer trucks. Over 97% of trucking companies today have fewer than 20 power units.</p> 

<p>According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) there were 493,730 trucking companies operating in the United States in 2016. That number is down slightly from a few years ago, but the fact remains: many of America's small business owners are truckers.</p> 


<h2>Trucking Remains a Solid Career Path</h2>

<p>When compared with U.S. household median income, driving a truck remains a good way to make a living. According to the National Transportation Institute (NTI), for-hire drivers earn an average annual income of $54,000, while private fleet drivers make well over $70,000, on average. Median income for all U.S. households was $56,516 in 2016, according to U.S. Census numbers.</p> 

<p>Trucking remains a solid, middle-class living, but there is concern about the industry’s wage growth and ability to recruit younger workers. According to the NTI, driver compensation has risen only 6.3% over the past five years. By comparison, the minimum wage has increased 45.2% over the same period of time.</p>

324,0,Blog Posts,What is Over-The-Road Trucking Like Today? ,What is Over-The-Road Trucking Like Today? ,"<p>More than 3.5 million Americans drive commercial trucks today, hauling everything from electronics to automotive parts to Idaho potatoes. Many of these drivers have spent decades behind the wheel as company drivers or owner-operators. Despite the long hours and time away from home, over-the-road trucking has <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/why-trucking-still-america-s-number-one-job"">provided drivers with a good income in a job that helps power the American economy</a>.</p>
<p>Trucking is changing, however, with electronic logging, autonomous technology and a driver shortage grabbing headlines in recent years. We at RTS Financial wanted to hear truck drivers’ unfiltered opinions about these and other issues affecting their industry. To get their thoughts, we headed down the highway to Harrisonville, MO.</p>
<p>On a warm October afternoon at the Sapp Bros. travel center, several truck drivers ambled over to chat with us on their way from the fuel lanes to the cash register. Below are their chief concerns and opinions about over-the-road trucking today.</p>
<h2>The Impact of ELDs</h2>
<p>Thomas, a self-described “box jockey” dry van trucker based in Michigan, has more than 30 years’ driving experience under his belt. He has logged more than 2.5 million miles for two different trucking fleets in his career. A typical month for Thomas is nearly 30 days on the road and only three days at home.</p>
<p>“I throw money at my house, but I live in my truck,” he said.</p>
<p>Thomas’s employer has used Qualcomm electronic logging devices (ELDs) for years, so the controversial Dec. 18 deadline for most truck drivers to use ELDs will not change the way he operates. In fact, Thomas predicts the new federal regulation will weed out many truck drivers and fleets that cheat on their paper logs and violate hours-of-service rules. Forcing those truckers off the highways is something he would welcome.</p>
<p>“Some of these truckers,” Thomas said, nodding toward the rigs parked in the fuel lanes, “I wouldn’t give a nickel for.”</p>
<p>Other drivers are less enthusiastic about ELDs. Andre, who hauls produce cross-country for a 500-truck fleet, has used a logging device for three years. The technology is strict in calculating and enforcing hours-of-service rules, which require drivers to take a 10-hour break after 11 hours on the clock. Andre said that doesn’t always jibe with his sleep schedule.</p>
<p>“Your (hours-of-service) clock is running. It don’t care,” he said. “It makes you drive when you’re tired.”</p>
<p>Jay, a fleet owner who operates five trucks out of Arkansas, is uncertain if he will be required to comply with the ELD requirement on Dec. 18. His fleet operates “glider kits”—newer trucks with older engines installed—which may exempt him from the new rule. The ELD mandate only applies to trucks built after the 2000 model year. Jay is unsure if that loophole applies to new trucks with old engines. Regardless, he expects his company to eventually adopt ELDs.</p>
<p>“When the law goes in for us, we’ll go to the tablets,” he said. “My wife will take care of that.”</p>
<h2>Detention Time Blues</h2>
<p>Some of the truckers we interviewed oppose ELDs because their mandated service times include the many hours spent parked at distribution centers, waiting to pick up or deliver a load. The amount of time that truck drivers spend in “detention” is a growing industry problem. Many truckers are paid by the mile, so they aren’t making money while waiting on shippers and receivers. At the same time, hours of service includes detention time, which limits the number of hours drivers can spend driving—and making money—during a shift.</p>
<p>Kelvin, who hauls refrigerated loads out of Atlanta, said he just spent five hours waiting to unload at a Walmart facility. That kind of delay is pretty typical, but nothing like the 24 hours he once had to spend at a distribution center in Florida.</p>
<p>“Sometimes it takes all day just to load,” Kelvin said. “I think ELDs are going to make that an even bigger issue.”</p>
<p>If electronic logging means stricter enforcement of hours of services, many drivers believe that shippers and receivers should compensate them more money for wasted time and lost wages. Many shippers and brokers do provide drivers $50 per hour in contingent pay for detention times exceeding three hours. That’s not enough, said Tim, a company driver who operates a refrigerated truck.</p>
<p>“You’re at the mercy of the shipper or receiver,” he said. “They don’t care. They get away with murder. We need to hold them a little more accountable for the amount of time you’re stuck there.”</p>
<h2>Sharing the Road with Four-Wheelers</h2>
<p>Truck drivers may be split on government regulations, but they all seem to agree that sharing the highways with smaller vehicles is one of the biggest risks of the job. Mark, who hauls boats for a major trucking fleet, said much of the motoring public—which many truckers call “four wheelers”—is ignorant about heavy trucks. Smaller trucks, cars and SUVs often cut right in front of the nose of Mark’s Kenworth, paying no heed to how much room he needs to safely slow his 80,000-pound rig.</p>
<p>“If a day goes by that I don’t see something stupid done by somebody, that’s rare,” he said. “It’s not that they’re stupid, it’s that they don’t know any better.”</p>
<p>John, a retired military veteran who now drives a dedicated Walmart truck for Swift Transportation, loves his job but is often shocked by what some drivers attempt to do in heavy traffic. The reckless behavior seems to be getting worse as more trucks and cars than ever before must share the road.</p>
<p>“They do not respect the size of the vehicle. They don’t give us the room we need and you know it’s just a matter of time before someone loses a life,” John said.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure and Parking</h2>
<p>Justin, from Springfield, MO, has only been driving a truck for two years. That’s long enough for him to form some opinions about the industry. One of the biggest daily problems the refrigerated and dry van driver faces is finding adequate parking. Justin, who often travels with his wife, said it can take him 30 minutes to an hour to find a place to park his rig when he needs to be off duty. The summer season, when campers and RVs take up many spots at travel centers and truck stops, is especially difficult.</p>
<p>“It can be just as challenging in the middle of the day as the middle of the night, because everyone is stopping for lunch,” he said.</p>
<p>President Donald J. Trump won the vote of many truckers because of his promise to spend $1 trillion fixing America’s crumbling highways, bridges and supporting amenities. Mark, who has 40 years of driving experience, said poor infrastructure is a nationwide problem. Some stretches of Interstate like the 200 miles between Dallas and Oklahoma City on I-35 are so bad that his back often hurts from driving them.</p>
<p>“We got a lot of infrastructure issues and we don’t have the political will to fix them,” Mark said.</p>
<h2>Ups and Downs of the Trucking Life</h2>
<p>Over-the-road work has always been a tough way to make a living. With increased regulations, frequent delays and incomes that have not kept pace with inflation, driving a truck seems to be getting tougher. Many young workers who would be ideal truck-driving candidates now opt for jobs that keep them closer to home. The average age of a U.S. truck driver today is 55—just 10 ten years shy of retirement. The American Trucking Associations estimates there is currently a shortage of 36,000 truck drivers in the industry. That number is expected to increase to more than 50,000 by the end of 2017.</p>
<p>Kent operates a rig out of Montana and often hauls Idaho potatoes this time of year. Whenever possible, he takes his wife and three-year-old boy along with him. Their tractor-trailer cab is as big as a small apartment, and Kent’s son loves pointing out and identifying the models of other rigs on the road.</p>
<p>Kent appreciates the trucking life, but he doesn’t like some of the changes. For one thing, the comradery and cooperation among trucker drivers is now mostly part of a bygone era.</p>
<p>“It used to be, if someone broke down, you would stop and help them out. That doesn’t happen so much anymore,” he said. “It’s a different world, a different time now.”</p>
<p>Still, most drivers we talked to said the positives outweigh the negatives. While Kelvin could do without the detention times, he loves trucking through places like Texas, where all things—including truck-stop diner meals—are bigger.</p>
<p>“My favorite part of trucking is just seeing the country. It’s just beautiful,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, truck driving still provides a good income if you know what you’re doing, said Thomas, the 30-year driving veteran.</p>
<p>“Some of us are good enough that we get special benefits,” he said, mentioning that his fleet pays for cable TV in his cab. “You can’t beat that with an ugly stick.”</p>
<p>One thing that hasn’t changed is the pride truck drivers still take in their work. They’re part of an industry that hauls 10 billion tons of freight year a year and generated $676 billion in 2016 revenue. Trucking, some of them pointed out, still drives the American economy.</p>
<p>“Remember, you couldn’t have it if we didn’t bring it,” Thomas said as he walked back to his truck in the Sapp Bros. fuel lane.</p>

<p>From the time the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issued its final rule on electronic logging devices in late 2015, much of the trucking industry has been mindful about ELDs. On Dec. 18, 2017, the nationwide ELD mandate took effect--a move opposed by many independent owner-operators and small carriers that still use paper logs.</p>

<p>The following guide from RTS Financial is designed to address any questions or concerns you have about ELDs. In addition to walking you through the requirements of the ELD mandate, you will find helpful information about how to adopt the technology for your trucking company. You will also learn about the benefits that ELDs may present for trucking fleets in the approaching years.</p>

<p>For additional information about ELDs, refer to our article, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/how-prepare-your-trucking-company-eld-mandate"">“How to Prepare Your Trucking Company for the ELD Mandate”</a> on the RTS Financial blog.</p>

<h2 class=""title"">What are ELDs and How Do They Work?</h2>

<p>An electronic logging device is a small piece of equipment that is used to track a vehicle’s drive time. Once an ELD is installed in your truck, the device synchronizes with the truck’s engine to automatically record when the engine is running.</p>

<div class=""sidebox sidebox-right bg-lt"">
	<p class=""xl-sans margin-top-0 blue""><span class=""d-xl margin-bottom-10"">3.4 million</span><br />
		truck drivers will be subject to the ELD rule, according to the FMCSA.</p>
</div>

<p>The ELD is designed to make it easier for carriers and truck drivers to accurately log their hours of service. The automation of an ELD replaces the time-consuming process of maintaining a paper log, while ensuring that the driver remains compliant with federal hours-of-service rules.</p>

<h3>ELDs and AOBRDs</h3>

<p>Today, many trucking companies log their hours with automatic on-board recording devices (AOBRDs). Under the new mandate, those fleets must phase out their use of AOBRDs and replace them with ELDs, but have been given more time to do it than carriers that don’t use any type of recording devices. While carriers currently using paper logs must switch to ELDs by Dec. 18, 2017, AOBRD users have until Dec. 16, 2019 to make the change.</p>

<p>Why are AOBRDs being phased out? Because ELDs are more technologically advanced and have greater reporting capabilities. An AOBRD can track a truck’s engine use, speed, miles driven, as well as the date and time. An FMCSA-certified ELD performs those functions, in addition to recording engine power status, vehicle motion status, and the vehicle’s location. ELDs can sense engine diagnostics and malfunctions, and can also automatically transfer record of duty status to the FMCSA.</p>

<h3>How Does an ELD Work?</h3>

<p>Once an ELD is plugged into a truck’s OBD-II port, it can integrate with software on a mobile app to transfer data to a driver’s phone or tablet. Once it has been synched up with a mobile device, the ELD can provide information about engine status, hours, idling, vehicle movement and miles driven. An ELD may also include GPS, allowing it to determine the vehicle’s location. By using the combination of an ELD and related mobile application software, hours-of-service logs and other data can appear on the screen of a smartphone or another wireless device. The information can be viewed, printed or emailed to an inspection officer upon request.</p>

<h2 class=""title"">The History of the ELD Mandate</h2>

<p>The mandate requiring the use of electronic logging may be a “new” rule, but it took a long time to create. Here is how the ELD mandate has evolved over the years:</p>

<h3>Early Attempts to Regulate</h3>

<p>The driving force behind the ELD mandate was the federal government’s concern about truck safety. As early as 2000, the FMCSA tried to work e-logging devices into its hours-of-service regulations. Electronic logging, the regulators said, would be more accurate than paper logs, ensuring that drivers and fleets would comply with limits on weekly hours of service. This in turn would reduce the number of exhausted, drowsy truck drivers on U.S. roads, leading to fewer truck-related accidents and highway deaths.</p>

<p>For years, the FMCSA’s attempts to mandate electronic logging were blocked by federal courts. Groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) also opposed an ELD rule, claiming it would lead to driver harassment by carriers and regulators.</p>

<h3>A Turning Point for ELDs</h3>

<p>In 2012, however, Congress passed a transportation bill called MAP-21 (“Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century”). The legislation included a provision requiring an ELD mandate for most commercial trucks to follow. At this point, many large trucking fleets had started using ELDs. The devices also had the support of the American Trucking Associations and other influential industry groups.</p>

<p>After public comment periods and approval from the Obama Administration’s Office of Management and Budget, the FMCSA published its final version of the ELD mandate in December 2015. The OOIDA immediately filed a lawsuit against the federal government over the new rule. However, two appeals courts upheld the rule and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear OOIDA’s case in June 2017.</p>

<p>The FMCSA has stated that the new mandate “improves commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety and reduces the overall paperwork burden for both motor carriers and drivers… (improving) compliance with the applicable HOS rules.”</p>

<h3>The Rule Moves Forward</h3>

<p>The election of President Donald Trump generated hope among some truckers that new regulations like the ELD mandate might be thrown out by the Department of Transportation. However, the FMCSA has moved forward with plans to implement the rule. On Dec. 18, 2017, trucking companies representing an estimated 3.4 million drivers were required to use ELDs. As early as April 1, 2018, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) will start penalizing fleets and drivers found to be noncompliant by putting them out of service.</p>

<h2 class=""title"">How ELDs Can Help Your Trucking Company</h2>

<p>If your trucks need to be equipped with ELDs, it might help you to know that the devices can be much more than just an added business expense.</p>

<p>Most large trucking fleets have been logging their hours-of-service electronically for years. Below are some of the advantages that ELD technology has brought many of those carriers. Your company could eventually see these benefits as well.</p>

<h3>ELDs Reduce Paperwork</h3>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices"">FMCSA</a>, truck drivers spend an average of 20 hours a year filling out logs and reporting their hours of service. The automation of ELDs eliminates all that paperwork, giving drivers more time to drive.</p>

<p>Electronic logging can add several hours a week of drive time because drivers can round up to the nearest minute for stops. Paper logbooks currently require rounding up to the nearest 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>Inspections Will Go Faster</h3>

<p>In the event of a roadside inspection, ELDs will make it easier for the inspecting officer to read the hours-of-service data. There will be no more sorting through a driver’s handwritten logbook. This should make inspections go faster and get your trucks back on the road a lot sooner.</p>

<h3>ELDs Help You Track Your Fleet</h3>

<p>The accuracy of electronic logging should make your trucking operation better-informed and more efficient. ELDs can help you monitor your trucks’ locations through GPS tracking, giving you real-time visibility to your fleet. This cuts down on the amount of time spent texting and calling drivers to learn their locations. Many ELDs can integrate with dispatch software, helping trucking companies plan shorter and more efficient routes. The results can include better fleet productivity and reduced costs of doing business.</p>

<h3>ELDs Eliminate Mistakes</h3>

<p>In tracking their hours of service on paper, drivers can sometimes make mistakes. It’s easy to enter the wrong time or location. Poor reporting in logbooks can catch up with a trucking company, leading to rising CSA scores and fines.</p>

<p>An ELD automatically calculates hours of service, IFTA fuel tax reporting and driver-vehicle inspection reports. Because the device is connected to a truck’s engine, it can also warn of any performance or maintenance issues. More accurate reporting from ELDs helps eliminate mistakes and keeps your trucks on the road.</p>

<h3>Your Trucks Can Log More Miles</h3>

<p>ELDs will be an added expense for your trucking company—the FMCSA estimates an average annual cost of $495 per device. However, ELDs can more than pay for themselves over time by making your fleet more productive and efficient.</p>

<p>With less paperwork and administration, your trucks can spend more time moving freight. With the engine diagnostics and GPS tracking that ELDs provide, your trucks should spend less time in the shops and at loading docks. In the long run, these efficiencies should generate more profits for your trucking company.</p>

<h3>You Can Save More on Fuel</h3>

<p>Because they track a truck engine’s activity, ELDs can tell you how much time your trucks are idling, just burning through diesel. Once you identify drivers who spend too much time idling, you can encourage them to adopt better driver habits. This can help reduce your company’s fuel consumption—the Department of Energy estimates that 1,500 gallons of diesel are burned each year by idling trucks.</p>

<h3>ELDs will Keep Your Trucks on the Road</h3>

<p>The main incentive to adopt ELDs for your trucking company is that the technology will soon become mandatory. An out-of-service penalty from inspectors, even for a few hours, can be disastrous for a small carrier.</p>

<p>In addition to the other potential advantages they provide, ELDs can give you the peace of mind that your company is compliant with the new federal mandate. You won’t have to worry about the fines and penalties that non-compliant carriers now face.</p>

<h2 class=""title"">The Eight Most Common Questions About ELDs</h2>

<p>During the countdown to the Dec. 18 deadline for ELD compliance, drivers and fleet owners still had a lot of questions about ELD mandate.</p>

<p>Below are eight frequent questions we at RTS Financial hear while serving our trucking customers, followed by thorough, up-to-date answers.</p>

<h3>Q: Do all heavy trucks have to comply with the ELD rule?</h3>

<p>Most commercial motor vehicles will be required to have an ELD. Exemptions from the ELD rule include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fleets operating heavy trucks manufactured prior to the year 2000.</li>
	<li>Drivers who only use paper duty status records for eight days or less during a 30-day period.</li>
	<li>Drivers who do not have to keep a records-of-duty status.</li>
	<li>Vehicles that are also the product being delivered (drive-away/tow-away).</li>
	<li>Carriers that only perform short hauls within a 100-air-mile radius.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Q: Does the ELD rule apply to owner-operators and small fleets?</h3>

<p>Yes, it does. Small carries and owner-operators that do not qualify for an exemption must now equip their trucks with ELDs.</p>

<h3>Q: Do hot shot trucking fleets have to use ELDs?</h3>

<p>The FMCSA provides an exemption from the ELD mandate for carriers with vehicles that do not require CDLs and operate within a 150-air-miles radius of their headquarters. To learn more about this exemption, <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices"">visit the FMCSA website here</a>.</p>

<h3>Q: How much will it cost me to equip my trucks with electronic logs?</h3>

<p>The cost of an ELD can vary widely, depending on what kinds of capabilities you want it to have. The FMCSA has estimated that an ELD could cost anywhere from $165 to $832 per year, per truck. RTS Financial’s partner, Transflo, offers <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/great-way-save-money-and-prepare-eld-mandate"">two types of electronic logging devices that cost $25 or $35 per month.</a> that cost $25 or $35 per month. If you purchase Transflo’s Standard or Fleet Telematics ELDs through RTS Financial or RTS Carrier Services, you can save $99 for each device.</p>

<h3>Q: I have an electronic logging system, but it’s old. Do I have to get a new one?</h3>

<p>You may currently be using an automatic on-board recording device (AOBRD). If so, you have a little more time before you need to worry about upgrading to ELDs. The deadline when drivers using AOBRDs must comply with the new ELD regulation is Dec. 16, 2019.</p>

<h3>Q: Can I just log my hours on my phone?</h3>

<p>You can use your phone or tablet to help track hours of service, but you will also need an ELD physically installed in your truck. The hardware of the ELD device records engine data and driving activity. Your phone or tablet can be used to download compliant mobile application software that works with the ELD’s data to track drive time, duty status, driver breaks and other operational information.</p>

<h3>Q: How big a deal is this for trucking?</h3>

<p>The ELD mandate is expected to affect most of the trucking industry. The FMCSA estimates that 3.4 million commercial truck drivers must comply with the rule. Some studies have estimated that as many as 2 million trucks do not use any type of electronic logging today.</p>

<h3>Q: How will the government know whether I’m using ELDs or not?</h3>

<p>ELD non-compliance can be detected during a DOT audit or a roadside inspection. The penalties for not having an ELD can be stiff: fines of as much as $11,000 per incident, in addition to possible temporary or permanent shutdown orders.</p>

<h2 class=""title"">Talking to Your Drivers About ELDs</h2>

<p>By now, you may understand that a lot of misinformation about the ELD mandate has been circulated on the Internet. Your trucking company’s drivers may have varying opinions about the new rule and what it means for their livelihoods. Some of them may feel that electronic logging violates their personal privacy. Others may see the benefits of ELDs and be willing to use them.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps you can take to inform your drivers about the ELD mandate and your company’s plans to address it.</p>

<h3>Communicate and Listen</h3>

<p>Share with your drivers the reliable information you have collected about ELDs and the mandate. Communicate your company’s ELD plans, timelines and goals well in advance. Most importantly, be willing to listen to drivers’ questions and concerns about the technology and the regulatory requirements. Make sure that everyone on your team understands the mandate and how your company will respond to it.</p>

<h3>Emphasize the Positives</h3>

<p>Regardless of how you or your drivers feel about ELDs, the devices soon will be a requirement. While installing ELDs and the related software may be a short-term hassle, the technology can bring several benefits as well. Emphasize to your team members how ELDs will increase their time on the road, reduce paperwork, improve efficiencies and eventually make your company more profitable. Once your company adapts to using ELDs, the long-term advantages will begin to take effect.</p>

<h3>Find Some Advocates</h3>

<p>Some of your drivers may be more receptive to electronic logging than others. Some may have used ELDs with their previous employers. Cultivate these drivers and other employees as your first wave of ELD adopters. Allow them to influence the rest of your team and help with training on how to maximize their use of the devices. Celebrate internal success stories of drivers who have had good experiences using ELDs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Selling your goods to customers in the United States can represent a huge growth opportunity for your business. After all, the U.S. economy remains the largest of all countries, representing 25% of the gross world product. Last year, the U.S. was the world’s second largest importer after the European Union, importing a total of $2.7 trillion in goods and services.</p>

<p><img src=""/sites/default/files/Top-10-U.S.-Imports-v3.jpg"" style=""float: right; max-width: 390px !important; padding: 0 0 40px 40px;"" /></p>

<p>However, doing business with buyers in the United States can be challenging. The U.S. is a huge country with a complex web of tariffs, taxes and requirements that are specific to different states. The American way of communicating and doing business may also be very different from your country’s cultural traits.</p>

<p>Below are a few insights on how to successfully break into the U.S. market. The first tip may be the most important: have a buyer, agent or distributor in the U.S. who values your product and can help you navigate the country’s rules and business practices.</p>

<h2>Have a Trusted Partner in the U.S.</h2>

<p>The quickest, most effective way to start doing business in the United States is to have a reliable customer or business partner that knows how to import into the country. Your U.S.-based buyer or distributor should be able to provide you with instructions on the invoicing, packaging, marking and labeling your products require.</p>

<p>Make sure your U.S.-based partner has also made a careful check of the U.S. Customs and other government agencies’ requirements that must be met when your merchandise arrives. A reputable U.S. Customs broker can assist you and your trade partner with information and filing of the customs entry and any other reporting that is necessary to other government agencies.</p>

<p>To protect your company’s interests, you will need to perform due diligence checks on any potential U.S. customer or distributor and draft contracts defining the key terms of the business relationship. To help with these agreements, you should get legal guidance from a lawyer who is familiar with U.S. law, as well as the U.S. states laws where your goods will be sold. The American Bar Association has helpful information about U.S. law firms, as well as an <a href=""https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/flh-home/flh-bar-directories-and-lawyer-finders.html"">online state-by-state directory</a>.</p>

<h2>Research the Market</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the United States is not a single national market. It is a federal system in which each state operates as a separate entity with its own set of procedures.</p>

<p>Once you identify the U.S. states where you plan to sell your product, you will need to determine the costs and other implications of doing business in those states. Is there a customer need for your product in the parts of the U.S. you plan to serve? How will your pricing compare with that of direct competitors? A careful market analysis is needed to ensure your goods will be well received by American customers.</p>

<p>The American way of doing business can also be unique from other cultures. Communications with U.S. businesses tend to be very direct, with negotiations focused on closing deals. In talking with your American partners, you will be expected to “get to the point” and articulate the bottom line advantages of your product.</p>

<h2>Pay Attention to the Details</h2>

<p>To ensure faster clearance through U.S. customs, pay close attention to U.S. tariffs, laws and instructions. Prepare your customs invoices carefully, including all the information that would be needed in a well-prepared packing list. Include detailed descriptions in English of the goods or merchandise being shipped. Make sure you comply with any special provisions related to food, drugs, alcohol, cosmetics, radioactive materials and other products.</p>

<p>Generally, the following documents will need to accompany the importation of any goods into the United States. As a seller, you will be responsible for providing the first three documents:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bill of lading (ocean, air, truck or freight)</li>
	<li>Commercial invoice</li>
	<li>Packing list</li>
	<li>Air waybill</li>
	<li>Binding rulling</li>
	<li>Cargo release/simplified entry</li>
	<li>Customs bond</li>
	<li>Customs import declaration</li>
	<li>Entry/immediate delivery</li>
	<li>Importer security filing</li>
	<li>Manifest for aircraft, motor carrier or vessel</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, to help protect your cargo from theft, establish sound security procedures at your warehouse and while transporting your goods for shipment. Do not give narcotics smugglers an opportunity to use your cargo to transport narcotics.</p>

<h2>Become Familiar with Incoterms</h2>

<p>When exporting products to the United States, it is important to understand your responsibilities over the goods being shipped. <a href=""https://www.rtsinternational.com/article/importance-incoterms"">International Commercial Terms</a>, commonly known as “Incoterms,” are the contractual rules that govern the movement of international freight. Published and periodically updated by the International Chamber of Commerce, Incoterms help determine how goods are shipped and which party is responsible—the seller or the buyer—for the shipment.</p>

<p>Three of the more common arrangements under Incoterms are the following:</p>

<p><strong>Carrier Paid To (CPT)</strong>—The seller of a product is responsible for the payment of freight to ship that product to the import country. Once the product has been delivered to the carrier, the buyer accepts responsibility for the shipment and its destination.</p>

<p><strong>Ex Works (EXW)</strong>—The buyer arranges the full shipment from the supplier’s warehouse to the cargo’s destination.</p>

<p><strong>Free Carrier (FCA)</strong>—The seller arranges most or all of the shipping stages from the exporting country. The buyer accepts liability once the goods arrive at the carrier’s terminal for export.</p>

<p>There are a total of 11 Incoterms and their language can be complex. Before making an international shipment, work with an in-house specialist, a customs broker, a freight forwarder or a third-party logistics provider who understands international shipping rules.</p>

<h2>Know the Cost of Exporting</h2>

<p>U.S. Customs’ duty or tariff is a tax placed on goods that are transported across international borders. Taxes and tariffs increase the cost of your product to your U.S. buyer. Knowing the final cost to your buyer is essential to pricing your product for the U.S. market. If you are based in a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement, your products may be duty-free.</p>

<p>If you know the classification number or “HS code” for the product you are exporting, you can use several online tools to help estimate U.S. tariff rates on your products. The U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Administration’s website <a href=""https://www.export.gov/welcome"">Export.gov</a> contains several links to websites that can help calculate the cost of exporting to the United States.</p>

<h2>Additional Resources</h2>

<p>Consulting your trade partner or a licensed professional is the most effective way to learn how to export to the United States. The following resources also contain helpful information about U.S. Custom and other regulations:</p>

330,0,Blog Posts,How the Tax Reform Bill Could Affect Your Business,How the Tax Reform Bill Could Affect Your Business,"<p>In December, President Donald J. Trump and Congressional Republicans made good on their promise to pass a sweeping reform of the U.S. tax code.</p>

<p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will go into effect for the 2018 tax year. The bill contains several changes to tax rates, brackets and deductibles that can help reduce taxes for most U.S. citizens and businesses.</p>

<p>What follows below are the key components of the tax reform that may affect you and your business. Some of these changes will be clarified in the coming months by the Internal Revenue Service. It is a good idea to consult a CPA or tax advisor to fully understand the impact of the tax reform on your business.</p>

<h2>The Corporate Tax Rate</h2>

<p>The biggest change under the new tax plan is that the tax rate for U.S. corporations will be slashed from 35% to 21%. This cut was designed to make the U.S. more competitive with countries that have lower corporate taxes. Companies that are C corporations can benefit from the new 21% tax rate while also deducting state and local taxes.</p>

<h2>The “Pass-Through” Loophole</h2>

<p>Another change that could have a big impact on some businesses’ tax exposure is a new deduction on “pass-through” income. This rule allows people with pass-through profits from a partnership, sole proprietorship or a limited liability corporation to write off 20% of that income before calculating their taxes.</p>

<p>For employee-driven businesses like manufacturers, retailers or trucking fleets, the 20% deduction can be applied to 50% of the cost of payroll. The deduction is designed to encourage companies to hire additional employees, pay down debt or purchase new equipment.</p>

<h2>More Write-Offs for Capital Expenses</h2>

<p>The tax reform bill permanently increases the amount of expenditures that small businesses can deduct under Section 179 from $500,000 to $1 million. Businesses can now also claim bonus depreciation on new and used equipment or property acquired between Sept. 27, 2017 and Jan. 1, 2023.</p>

<h2>Per Diem Rates Stay Intact</h2>

<p>The new tax bill makes no changes to per diem rates for truck drivers and other workers. For trucking companies, that means drivers can still claim 80% of expenses they incur for dining and lodging while working away from home. The standard per diem rate for U.S. transportation workers will remain at $63 per day. Workers can declare 80% of that daily amount as a tax deduction.</p>

<h2>Brackets for Individuals</h2>

<p>Many business owners will benefit from a reduction in the individual tax rates.</p>

<p>The U.S. tax code will continue to have seven income brackets. However, the percentage of taxable income has been reduced for all but two of the brackets. For 2017, the tax rates were 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%. Starting in 2018, those rates will be 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of the income brackets and the percentage each will pay in taxes under the new plan:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Single Filer Income</th>
			<th>Married, Filing Jointly</th>
			<th>Head of Household</th>
			<th>2018 Rate</th>

<h2>Employee Withholdings</h2>

<p>With the tax rates changing for most income brackets in 2018, the IRS is expected to issue new guidance on the tax withholdings for employees’ paychecks. That guidance could come as early as January 2018. Employers will be expected to implement the new tables on employees’ paychecks by February. The IRS guidance is expected to work with W-4 forms on withholdings that employees have already filled out.</p>

<h2>A New Standard Deduction</h2>

<p>For many individuals used to itemizing their deductions, their tax form in 2018 could become a lot simpler. The tax reform bill includes a new standard deduction of $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. That nearly doubles the standard deductions of $6,350 and $12,700 that individuals and married couples can claim on their 2017 taxes. If your itemized deductions are less than those amounts in 2018, you will be taking the standard deduction.</p>

335,0,Blog Posts,What the NAFTA Dispute Could Mean for Trucking ,What the NAFTA Dispute Could Mean for Trucking ,"<p>The United States’ decision to renegotiate or even exit the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will have a big impact on the trucking industry, which moves most of the country’s cross-border freight.</p>

<p>NAFTA was signed in 1994 as a free trade agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs and other restrictions on trade among the three partner countries.</p>

<p>Now, NAFTA may be in trouble. President Donald Trump has pledged to rework and possibly pull out of trade agreements that put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. Representatives for the U.S., Canada and Mexico have negotiated changes to the 24-year-old agreement for several months, with new meetings scheduled for Feb. 26 in Mexico City.</p>

<h2>Free Trade and Trucks</h2>

<p>While some criticize NAFTA as causing the outsourcing of American jobs, the trade agreement has been a success for many U.S. corporations and industry groups. Trucking has benefited greatly from the free movement of goods among the three partner countries. More than $525 billion in goods travel between the U.S. and Mexico in a year. Most of those goods are moved on trucks.</p>

<p>“The vast majority of products that go over the southern border and the northern border involve trucks,” Bob Costello, chief economist for the American Trucking Associations, recently told <em>Transport Topics</em>. “That’s generating $6.5 billion in revenue annually for our industry, and that means we’re employing over 46,000 people whose jobs sorely depend on NAFTA.”</p>

<p>About 31,000 of those jobs, Costello added, are truck drivers.</p>

<h2>The End for NAFTA?</h2>

<p>Trump’s election has fueled speculation that the U.S. may soon pull out of NAFTA. However, trade representatives for all three countries are working to hammer out a revised agreement. In the latest round of talks, the trade partners were at odds on three demands proposed by the U.S. Two additional issues also loom large in the talks:</p>

<p><strong>A Sunset Clause</strong> – The U.S. wants a clause that would force the renegotiation of NAFTA every five years, an idea Mexico and Canada have resisted.</p>

<p><strong>Automotive Manufacturing</strong> – The Trump Administration wants changes to NAFTA that would pressure automakers to shift more production from Mexico and Canada to the United States. So far, neither Mexico or Canada is willing to accept that proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Resolving Trade Disputes</strong> – The U.S. wants to cut the authority of arbitration dispute panels in settling trade disagreements, which is another sticking point with the two other trade partners.</p>

<p><strong>The Border Wall</strong> – Though not a part of the talks, Trump’s proposed wall along all or most of the U.S.-Mexico border has added tension to negotiations with Mexican leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Elections</strong> – There is some urgency to the NAFTA talks because Mexico will elect a new president on July 1. The U.S. midterm elections in November could also influence negotiations if a revised trade pact is not agreed upon by then.</p>

<h2>What Does This Mean for Trucking?</h2>

<p>If a new NAFTA agreement is drafted and approved by the partner countries. It could provide more clarity for how trucking companies can operate under the trade pact. In 2015, the Obama Administration began allowing Mexican drivers to seek permission to drive beyond commercial zones along the U.S.-Mexico border. Few Mexican carriers have participated in this program and the Trump Administration is pushing to reduce or eliminate it. Mexico has proposed creating a committee that would ensure all modes of transportation crossing the border are compliant with safety standards under NAFTA.</p>

<p>American Trucking Associations Chief Economist Bob Costello has said the most recent NAFTA negotiations in Montreal were constructive, but progress has been slow. In a Feb. 1 letter to ATA members, he expressed doubt that an end-of-March deadline would be met for a new NAFTA agreement. If a new agreement is reached, it will have to be approved by Congress.</p>

<p>The U.S. or another country backing out of NAFTA remains possible. Trump continues to promise “a better deal” for the United States. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that his country “won’t be pushed around” and could walk away from NAFTA.</p>

<p>Economists predict such a move would have a huge impact on the U.S. economy, particularly the automotive industry. <em>Oxford Economics </em>recently concluded that ending NAFTA would have a limited effect on the U.S. trade deficit, but that it would reduce growth in all three countries. The Business Roundtable has estimated that walking away from NAFTA would cost the U.S. 1.8 million jobs.</p>

<p>There is still hope that a new deal will be reached. A recent poll by Reuters showed most economists expect NAFTA to undergo only minor changes, despite political threats to end the treaty.</p>

342,0,Blog Posts,No Fooling: ELD Enforcement Begins on April 1 ,No Fooling: ELD Enforcement Begins on April 1 ,"<p>The federal mandate requiring most commercial trucks to track hours of service with electronic logging devices (ELDs) officially went into effect on Dec. 18, 2017. However, law enforcement agencies will not begin enforcing the mandate—and penalizing drivers for ELD violations—until April 1.</p>

<p>With that deadline just days away, here are some important things to know about the ELD mandate and how it will be enforced:</p>

<h2>Not all states plan to enforce the mandate.</h2>

<p>The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) will start enforcing the ELD mandate on April 1 by putting truck drivers out of service for 10 hours or adjusting their safety scores. However, several states need to adopt the federal ELD rule as part of their safety regulation codes before they can begin enforcing it. At least four states—South Dakota, Missouri, Idaho and Tennessee—have even proposed legislation intended to block ELD enforcement within their borders.</p>

<h2>Livestock haulers may be exempt.</h2>

<p>Since the ELD mandate went into effect in December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has clarified how carriers that haul horses and other livestock will be affected. The new guidelines posted in late February provide ELD and commercial driver’s license exceptions for the transportation of horses and other animals to shows and events. Other agricultural transportation, such as covered farm vehicles or the movement of commodities within a 150-air-mile radius, are also exempt from the ELD rule.</p>

<h2>Other exemptions remain in place.</h2>

<p>If your trucking company meets any of the following descriptions, you do not have to use ELDs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fleets operating heavy trucks manufactured prior to the year 2000.</li>
	<li>Drivers who only use paper duty status records for eight days or less during a 30-day period.</li>
	<li>Drivers who do not have to keep a records-of-duty status.</li>
	<li>Vehicles that are also the product being delivered (drive-away/tow-away).</li>
	<li>Carriers that only perform short hauls within a 100-air-mile radius.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Having an older recording device buys you more time.</h2>

<p>Drivers who track their hours of service with automatic on-board recording devices (AOBRD) have a little more time before needing to upgrade to ELDs. The deadline when drivers using AOBRDs must comply with the ELD regulation is Dec. 16, 2019.</p>

<h2>Rule-breakers can be put out of service.</h2>

<p>Starting in April, a driver can be put out of service for 10 hours by law enforcement for the following violations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using an ELD device that is not registered with the FMCSA.</li>
	<li>Not being able to produce a record of on-duty status from an ELD or AOBRD device.</li>
	<li>The truck is not equipped with an ELD or an AOBRD.</li>
	<li>The driver has falsified his hours-of-service log.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ELDs are really happening.</h2>

<p>Some trucking groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) continue to challenge the ELD mandate. However, the rule has now been in place for three months now. Since December, the CVSA and other law enforcement have been issuing “soft” warnings to drivers who are not using ELDs.</p>

<p>In other words, ELDs are not going away. Drivers and carriers that are not compliant could pay a hefty price during a DOT audit or roadside inspection.</p>

352,0,Blog Posts,How to Get the Best Loads in a Booming Truckload Market,How to Get the Best Loads in a Booming Truckload Market,"<p>You don’t have to be an economic expert to know that things are going well right now for trucking.</p>

<p>Increased shipping demand, plus a lingering shortage of commercial truck drivers, have combined to form a carrier-friendly freight market. The new federal mandate on electronic logging devices—which cracks down on drivers’ hours of service and limits their availability—has also contributed to escalating freight rates. For example, the average per-mile spot rate for a flatbed load today is $2.50, about 25% more than a year ago. The flatbed load-to-truck ratio was an incredible 90.8-to-1 as recently as March. Other trucking modes, like dry van and reefer, have seen similar bumps in rates and shipper demand.</p>

<p>Hopefully, your trucking company is already capitalizing on this market trend. To make sure you are booking the most profitable, well-paying loads for your business, here are a few friendly tips:</p>

<h2>Know Your Numbers</h2>

<p>To find the most profitable loads for your company, you need to know your trucking company’s operating costs, available cash and revenue. Many owner-operators and small fleets actually lose money on some loads because they are not familiar enough with their financials.</p>

<p>You can avoid that trap by calculating the per-mile freight rates that will make money for your company. While rates are up right now, how do they measure against your expenses, cash flow and other rates in the regions where you operate? To learn how to make calculations that determine a load’s profitability, check out our articles, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/trucking-calculations-formulas"">“How to Calculate Cost per Mile for Your Trucking Company,”</a> and <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/how-calculate-revenue-and-profit-mile"">“How to Calculate Revenue and Profit per Mile.”</a></p>

<h2>Tighten Your Customer Criteria</h2>

<p>A strong trucking market should allow you to be more particular about the companies you serve. If you haven’t already, make a list of the qualities you look for in a good customer. Your list may look something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pays quickly or on time</li>
	<li>Good communicator</li>
	<li>Has short wait times at pick-up and delivery</li>
	<li>Provides loads regularly</li>
	<li>Has a good reputation</li>
	<li>Is financially secure</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a list of criteria sets a standard for your trucking company and can help you focus on finding long-term business partners. Finding better brokers and shippers to work with now can also help your trucking company endure times when rates are lower and quality loads are less plentiful.</p>

<h2>Always Check Credit Scores</h2>

<p>Knowing the credit ratings and days-to-pay information on a broker or shipper improves your chances of making the best possible business decisions and getting paid in a timely manner. At a time when the freight market is booming, there is really no reason you need to accept a load from a shipper with a poor credit or payment history. Our exclusive <a href=""http://www.carrierpro.com"">CarrierPro web browser and mobile application</a> has credit information on over 50,000 brokers and shippers, and can be accessed for free by RTS Financial and RTS Carrier Services customers.</p>

<h2>Eliminate Deadhead Miles</h2>

<p>More available loads mean there should be more opportunities to make money on return trips back to or near your home base. In some cases, you may be able to use the same shipping customer for an outbound “re-load.” At other times, you may be an able to perform a backhaul for a different shipper than you did for the outbound freight.</p>

<p>These kinds of hauls reduce the number of miles your trailers run empty. A few years ago, fleets would regularly run 100 or more “deadhead” miles to get to the next load. That average is now less than 50 miles, industry experts say. In other words, carriers are getting smarter about maximizing their time on the road. Today’s trucking market, with its skyrocketing load-to-truck ratios, should make it easier than ever to eliminate deadheading from your balance sheet.</p>

<h2>Be More Selective with Brokers</h2>

<p>Federal regulations have helped push out some bad freight brokers in recent years. However, many brokers seem to care a great deal more about their shipping customers than for the carriers who move freight for them. At a time when all freight brokers are looking to build more trucking capacity to meet shipping demands, you do not need to settle for a broker that gives you less-profitable loads and then takes weeks to pay. Seek out brokers with decades of experience, a good reputation in the industry and payment terms of 10 days or less.</p>

<h2>Take Advantage of the Load Boards</h2>

<p>There are hundreds of online load boards out there. The most popular ones include <a href=""http://www.dat.com"">DAT</a>, <a href=""http://www.truckstop.com"">Truckstop.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.getloaded.com"">GetLoaded.com</a>. Which load board provides you with the best hauls in the lanes you want your trucks to run? Instead of committing to one or two boards for most of your loads, take some time to sign up with other boards that offer exclusive hauls. You will also want to post a profile about your company on each board you use, so that shippers have an easy way of finding you.</p>

357,357,Blog Posts,What Exporters Need to Know About the U.S. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA),What Exporters Need to Know About the U.S. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA),"<p>The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) was passed by Congress in 1930 as a way to establish fair trade and business practices in the fruit and vegetable industry. While PACA is not new, it is important for agricultural produce exporters that are selling their products in the U.S. for the first time to become familiar with this government regulation.</p>

<p>Below are five important facts about PACA, which is managed by <a href=""https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/paca"">the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>. To gain a more in-depth understanding of PACA’s rules and protections, it is always a good idea to consult an attorney who is an expert in PACA.</p>

<h2>Getting a PACA License</h2>

<p>Companies that buy or sell wholesale quantities of produce (meaning more than one ton of produce per day), need to be licensed by PACA. This requirement also applies to companies that buy or sell produce that crosses U.S. state lines.</p>

<p>PACA licenses can be obtained through the USDA. License fees are $995 per year, plus $600 for each additional branch location or business facility you have in the United States. The annual PACA fee cannot exceed $8,000, regardless of the size of your operation.</p>

<p>If you do not obtain a PACA license, your produce company is still governed by all PACA rules and you could pay a penalty of up to $1,200. The advantage of having a license is that it can more easily protect your PACA trust rights in the event a buyer goes out of business. The license also shows that your business can be trusted to meet its contractual obligations.</p>

<h2>Protection Under the PACA Trust</h2>

<p>The PACA trust was created as a way for produce sellers and suppliers to receive payment on undisputed amounts that are owed for product sales. Provisions under PACA require that buyers of produce maintain a statutory trust on fruits and vegetables received but not yet paid for. If the buyer’s business fails or enters into bankruptcy, the trust ensures that produce sellers are paid before other creditors if they file trust claims.</p>

<p>In order to preserve trust rights, a seller that is licensed under PACA must have the following wording on its invoices and other billing documents. Without it, there is no trust protection:</p>

<p><em>The perishable agricultural commodities listed on this invoice are sold subject to the statutory trust authorized by section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)). The seller of these commodities retains a trust claim over these commodities, all inventories of food or other products derived from these commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of these commodities until full payment is received.</em></p>

<p>Produce sellers that do not want to include that wording on their invoices must provide a written notice to a buyer within 30 days of a payment due date, informing the buyer that the seller wishes to preserve its PACA trust benefits.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution and Reparation Cases</h2>

<p>In the event of a dispute over whether payment is due on produce sold, the debtor can take one of three courses of action: PACA, the Fruit and Vegetable Dispute Resolution Corporation or the U.S. Courts. Companies that have PACA licenses can file reparation cases through PACA. The informal stage of a reparation case can take six months and involves a $100 filing fee to the USDA.</p>

<p>If the reparation case is not resolved informally, a formal proceeding can begin involving the buyer and seller. The average time to reach a decision in a PACA reparation case is two years with an administrative cost of $600. Companies that are nonresidents of the United States must post a bond to proceed with a formal complaint through PACA.</p>

<h2>PACA Enforcement</h2>

<p>The PACA act provides regulatory teeth for the USDA to use against companies that fail to pay for produce. When a PACA-licensed firm fails to pay an order, the USDA can suspend that company’s license and prohibit it from operating in the produce industry until the payment is made in full.</p>

<h2>Checking Up on Other PACA Licensees</h2>

<p>One advantage of PACA is that it establishes a business history for buyers, sellers and brokers dealing in produce. To obtain general information on a potential customer’s PACA complaint and license history, contact the USDA’s PACA division at (800) 495-7222.</p>

381,0,Blog Posts,How to Switch Factoring Companies,How to Switch Factoring Companies,"<h2 class=""margin-top-0"">Reasons for Switching</h2>

<p>There are a variety of reasons why a company may consider switching factors. Maybe your factor doesn’t have good customer service – they’re not picking up the phones or they’re treating your customers poorly. Perhaps your factor isn’t funding your invoices in a timely manner. Or, maybe you found another factor with better advance rates and lower fees. Regardless, if your needs are somehow not being met, you may be ready to switch factors. But where do you start?</p>

<h2>Leaving Your Current Factor</h2>

<p>You need to determine when your contract ends with your current factor and what fees may apply if you terminate early. Your contract term can normally be found under the “Termination Clause” section of your factoring agreement. You need to consider the fees associated with switching before committing to the change.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided to leave your current factor, you will need to give notice. All factoring companies require written notice to terminate the contract. The expectation is usually 30 – 60 days prior to the renewal date. You will need to verify whether your notice to terminate needs to be delivered via mail or if electronic notice is acceptable. </p>

<h2>The Cost of Switching</h2>

<p>When you decide to switch, the new factor buys the invoices originally purchased by the old factor. This means the new factor must pay whatever the old factor already advanced, plus any fees accrued to this point. The new factor will usually collect those fees from the customer (you) from invoices you submit once the switch is made.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Contract</strong> $50,000 in invoices per month | 2% | 12 months | 90% advance rate</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>No Fees: </strong>If you have $50,000 in open invoices, an advance rate of 90 percent and no fees, your buyout should be $45,000. The new factor will wire the old factor $45,000 and will then instruct your customers to pay the new factor.</li>
	<li><strong>Guaranteed or Non-Compliance Fees: </strong>If you have an agreement to factor $50,000 in invoices per month at 2%, your factor is guaranteed $1,000 per month. If you have a 12-month contract, your factor is entitled to $12,000 over that period. If you leave your factor after 8 months, you will owe $4,000 in guaranteed fees. This is typically added to your buyout amount.</li>
	<li><strong>Early-Termination Fees: </strong>The old factor may charge an early termination fee. If your new factor owes the old factor $45,000 for your invoices and the old factor also charges a $1,000 early-termination fee, the new cost of the buyout is $46,000.</li>
	<li><strong>Buyout Fee: </strong>The new factor may charge a buyout fee for moving the invoices over from the old factor. Typically, it’s 1 - 1.5% of the total buyout cost. If your total buyout was $45,000 and the buyout fee is an additional 1%, the cost is $450.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Buyout Process</h2>

<p>Once you submit notice, the new factor will reach out to your old factor to start the buyout process. The old factor must first agree upon a buyout date. The new factor will then take several steps to prepare for that date:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The new factor must verify the current aging report, which is a report that shows all the customer invoices the old factor currently has open. They will contact your customers to confirm the invoice was received and to ask for the scheduled date of payment.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value=""2"">After a certain portion of the aging has been verified, the buyout agreement will need to be signed by all three parties – the old factor, the client (you) and the new factor. The agreement will list the buyout amount, which will then be wired to the old factor from the new factor.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value=""3"">Once the buyout wire is received, the buyout transaction is complete. The new factor will terminate the old factor’s UCC filing. Additionally, they will request a release letter from the old factor. This letter can be used to show your customers that payment must now be made to the new factor. You will also receive a notice of assignment from your new factor to include on all your factoring invoices.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will I be involved in the buyout process?</h3>

<p>Most of the communication in the buyout process takes place between the old factor and the new factor. You may need to get involved if the new factor has trouble reaching a debtor for verification or needs copies of invoices to complete verification calls. </p>

<h3>Will I be without funding?</h3>

<p>Once the buyout process starts, there is a possibility that your funds will be held by either the old factor or the new factor to ensure that aging remains accurate and the buyout agreement stays the same.</p>

<h3>What if a payment is made to the old factor once I’ve switched to new factor?</h3>

<p>Per the buyout agreement, the old factor is contractually obligated and required by law to forward any payments received to the new factor.</p>

388,0,Blog Posts,Factoring vs. Merchant Cash Advance,Factoring vs. Merchant Cash Advance,"<p>Using factoring services or getting a merchant cash advance both put money in your bank account quickly, but there are several things to consider when deciding which is the best option for you.</p>

<h2>What is Factoring?</h2>

<p>Factoring is a financial service where a factoring company purchases your open invoices. You usually receive payment for those invoices within 24 hours. You can choose which invoices to sell to the factor and you’ll receive an advance on each of them. Some factoring companies advance up to 97% of the total amount of the invoice.</p>

<p>Since the factor purchases these invoices, they collect the payment from your customer. The factor then deducts its fee and returns the remaining balance. Factoring fees are typically small, so you should receive about 97-99% of the original invoice amount once the factor gets paid by your customer. If your customer does not pay, the factor manages the collections, not you.</p>

<p>Factoring is not a loan. You are collecting money for services already rendered and the factor makes its money on the factoring fee, so there is no interest involved. Factoring is commonly used in the trucking and oilfield industries because companies must purchase materials, pay labor and cover operating costs in advance of collecting payments from their customers. Factoring is also used by new businesses that need capital to support their growth but lack the credit history to obtain a traditional loan.</p>

<h2>What are Merchant Cash Advances?</h2>

<p>A merchant cash advance is a financial service where an MCA provider offers a cash advance based on your future credit card sales. You pay back the advance plus interest in installments from an agreed-upon percentage of your daily credit card sales. Oftentimes, it’s between 10 – 20%. This means the daily dollar amount that is debited directly to the MCA provider will vary, depending on the total amount of your credit card receipts on a given day. Interest rates for MCAs are typically high so you may end up paying as much as 20 – 40% more than the amount advanced.</p>

<p>Merchant cash advances are most often used by companies that have a lot of credit card sales, such as retail stores and restaurants. It’s easier for a small business that may not have a great credit history to qualify for an MCA.</p>

<h2>How Do Factoring and Merchant Cash Advances Compare?</h2>

<p>Factoring provides access to cash that has already been earned, usually within 24 hours, so you don’t have to wait 30 – 60 days for customers to pay. A factor will only purchase invoices for your customers that have a decent credit rating. Once the factor purchases the invoice, your risk of customer nonpayment is eliminated. The factor gets paid through factoring fees collected from each invoice.</p>

<p>A merchant cash advance is funded from future credit card sales. Once your application is approved, you’ll receive payment typically within two days. With no collateral and no personal guarantee required, the risk to the lender is high. This means the interest rates and fees may be high. The MCA provider gets paid a daily percentage of your credit card sales through direct access to your merchant account, until the full amount plus interest is paid in full.</p>

405,0,Blog Posts,Basic Accounting For Trucking Companies,Basic Accounting For Trucking Companies,"<p>No matter your fleet size or how long you have been in business, it is crucial to understand basic accounting terms and financial documents. Accounting explains your company’s financial history, health and overall performance. Without a good understanding of this information, you won’t know if you are succeeding or failing. That limits your ability to make informed decisions, operate effectively and position your company for future growth.</p>

<h2>Common Terms</h2>

<p>To get started, here are a few basic accounting terms and definitions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Assets</strong>: An asset is something of value that your company owns and can be converted into cash. This can include current assets such as accounts receivable, inventory and available cash. It also includes fixed assets like real estate, buildings and equipment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Liabilities</strong>: Liabilities are the debts and obligations of your business. They can include money owed on a loan, accounts payable, employee wages or taxes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Equity</strong>: Equity is your ownership interest in the business. In accounting, equity is calculated when a company’s liabilities are subtracted from its assets. Whatever remains from that calculation is your equity. When liabilities are larger than assets, negative equity exists.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Revenue and Gains</strong>: Revenue is the amount of money that a company receives over a given period of time for the services it provides. On an income statement, revenue is also known as top line or gross revenue. Gains are one-time increases in revenue that are not part of a company’s regular operations. Some examples of gains include the sale of equipment or real estate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Expenses and Losses</strong>: Expenses are what it costs the company to perform its main operations. Losses are one-time transactions in which the company sells an asset for less than the amount it spent to acquire the asset.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Financial Statements</h2>

<p>Understanding financial management involves some familiarity with financial statements. The three most common documents that companies use to gauge their financial health and performance are the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash flow statement.</p>

<p>A <strong>balance sheet</strong> is a snapshot of your company’s financial standing at any given point in time. It measures the relationship among assets, liabilities and equity. It also calculates your company’s debt load and overall financial health.</p>

<p>A <strong>cash flow statement</strong> shows how much actual cash the company has on hand. It also projects future cash flow. This is an important statement for small businesses and entrepreneurs because it shows a company’s day-to-day financial health. While the income statement shows how your company performed in the past, the cash flow statement shows how cash is being generated or used. A company can show a profit on its income statement, yet still go out of business because of a temporary negative cash flow.</p>

<p><a href=""/product/factoring-services"">Factoring</a> is when a factoring company purchases your open invoices. You usually receive payment for those invoices within 24 hours. The factoring company then collects payment on those invoices from your customers. Factoring is sometimes referred to as accounts receivable financing.</p>

<p>The main reason that companies factor is to get paid on their invoices quickly, rather than waiting the 30, 60 or sometimes 90 days it often takes a customer to pay. How much a company factors will depend on their unique business needs. Some companies factor all of their invoices, while others factor only invoices for customers that traditionally take longer to pay. With factoring, companies get the increased cash flow they need to pay employees, handle customer orders and take on more business. </p>

<h2>How Does Factoring Work?</h2>

<p>Factoring can be explained in five easy steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You perform a service for your customer.</li>
	<li>You send your invoice to a factoring company.</li>
	<li>You receive a cash advance on your invoice from the factoring company, typically within 24 hours. </li>
	<li>The factoring company collects full payment from your customer</li>
	<li>The factoring company pays you the rest of your invoice amount, minus a small fee. </li>
</ol>

<p>Additional benefits of factoring:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free back-office support, including managing your collections</li>
	<li>Based on the quality of your customers’ credit, not your own credit or business history</li>
	<li>Customized and managed to provide capital when your company needs it</li>
	<li>No debt incured (unlike traditional loans)</li>
	<li>Scalable - the amount of funding available grows with your company</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which Companies Use Factoring?</h2>

<p>Companies of all sizes, from single-person businesses to Fortune 500 corporations, use factoring as a way to build cash flow. Factoring is commonly used across multiple industries - trucking, transportation, manufacturing, government contracting, textiles, oilfield services, health care, staffing and more. Many companies use the cash generated from factoring to pay for inventory, buy new equipment, add employees, expand operations or any expenses related to operating the business. </p>

<h2>How Much Does Factoring Cost?</h2>

<p>The factoring company makes money on the factoring fees for each invoice. Different factors have different fee structures. Some only charge an overall factoring fee that is determined by the monthly volume of submitted invoices and the creditworthiness of a customer's clients. Some factoring providers have additional fees that cover money transfers, collateral and other operational costs. When choosing a factoring company, pay close attention to the fee structure. Make sure the factor you work with is upfront about the fees they charge. </p>

<h2>Are There Different Kinds of Factoring?</h2>

<p>The two main types of factoring are recourse and non-recourse. Recourse factoring means the factoring customer will ultimately take responsibility for the payment of an invoice if the factoring company cannot collect payment from the debtor (the customer's client). Non-recourse factoring means the factoring company assumes the majority of the credit risk for collecting on an invoice. Some factoring companies offer both recourse and non-recourse options. There are usually stipulations tied to non-recourse factoring, which typically has a highter factoring rate, so make sure you understand exactly what the non-recourse terms are before choosing this option. For more information, see our article on the <a href=""/guides/difference-between-recourse-and-non-recourse-factoring"">difference between recourse and non-recourse factoring</a>. </p>

<h2 class=""blue"">What is the FMCSA?</h2>

<p>Part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the FMCSA develops and enforces federal safety standards for commercial vehicles. Areas the agency oversees include CDL standards, carrier safety scores, drivers’ hours-of-service and driver medical examinations. The FMCSA also provides funding for states to conduct roadside truck inspections and other safety programs.</p>
</div>

<p>Trucking is a heavily regulated industry. Before your company can begin operating, there are numerous government requirements you will need to meet and also keep current.</p>

<p>This checklist walks you through all the steps necessary to start a trucking company, gain your authority and operate legally as an interstate trucking company. If you haven't already, learn <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-write-business-plan-your-trucking-company"">how to create a business plan</a> and <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/finding-right-insurance-your-trucking-company"">find the right insurance for your company</a>, and be sure to bookmark our <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/dictionary-trucking-terms"">Complete Guide to Trucking Terms</a> for a comprehensive trucking dictionary.</p>

<h2>#1 Get a Commercial Driver’s License</h2>

<p>In order to operate heavy trucks, all of your company’s drivers need valid commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs). Obtaining a license involves an extensive background check, CDL training, a written permit exam and a driving test. To be eligible for a CDL, you must be at least 18 years old. You must be at least 21 to drive a truck from state to state. Each state has different testing standards for CDLs. To learn what your state requires, pick up a CDL manual at your local Department of Motor Vehicles office.</p>

<h2>#2 Apply for Your Federal DOT and Motor Carrier Authority Numbers</h2>

<p>These numbers are required for your trucking company to haul cargo in the United States. The U.S. DOT number is used to track your company’s safety record and compliance with regulations. The motor carrier (MC) number, which is also known as “operating authority,” identifies the kind of trucking business you operate and the kinds of goods you are permitted to haul. You can acquire both numbers by registering your company with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).</p>

<p>To get both your MC and USDOT numbers, you must complete the Motor Carrier Identification Report (MCS-150) and Safety Certification Application. You will receive your MC and USDOT numbers after the application is filed, but your request for authority must still be reviewed by the FMCSA. That review includes a “mandated dispute period” in which your application is posted to the Federal Register for 10 business days. This period is to seek out public comment from anyone who might contest your application for authority.</p>

<p>For more information, <a href=""www.fmcsa.dot.gov"">visit the FMCSA’s website</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: To file for DOT registration, you must first register as a business through your state. This is typically done through the Secretary of State's office.</p>

<h2>#3 Complete Your Unified Carrier Registration (UCR)</h2>

<p>The UCR system was created to verify active insurance coverage in each state where a motor carrier operates. You must register using your company’s USDOT and MC numbers. To learn more about UCR, visit your home state's Department of Transportation website. </p>

<h2>#4 Get an International Registration Plan (IRP) Tag</h2>

<p>An IRP license plate issued by your company’s home state allows your truck to operate in all states, as well as most Canadian provinces. The plate requires an annual renewal fee. For more information, <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/international-programs/canada/international-registration-plan-irp"">visit the Department of Transportation website for the state where your company is based</a>.</p>

<h2>#5 Understand Heavy Use Tax Regulations</h2>

<p>Any truck that weighs 55,000 pounds or more is subject to the federal heavy-highway vehicle use tax. To pay taxes due on your heavy trucks, you must complete and file a 2290 tax form with the IRS on a yearly basis. For more information on the form, visit <a href=""http://www.irs.gov"">www.irs.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>#6 Obtain an International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) Decal</h2>

<p>The IFTA agreement was established to simplify the reporting of fuel used by trucks operating across the lower 48 U.S. states and some Canadian provinces. The rule allows your company to have a single fuel license and requires you to file quarterly fuel use tax returns with the state where you are based. To learn more about IFTA, visit your state’s Department of Transportation website.</p>

<h2>#7 File a BOC-3 Form</h2>

<p>One requirement to gain interstate operating authority is to register an up-to-date BOC-3 form with the FMCSA. The form designates a person in each state where your company operates to act as a legal “process agent.” For example, if your company is based in Missouri but you are sued by someone in Georgia, you need an attorney in Georgia who can receive the legal complaint and communicate it to you and your local attorney. For more information on the BOC-3 form, visit <a href=""www.fmcsa.dot.gov"">www.fmcsa.dot.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>#8 Get A Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC)</h2>

<p>The SCAC is a privately controlled code used to identify different transportation companies. If you plan to haul military, government, international or intermodal loads, you will need an SCAC code. For more information, visit <a href=""http://www.nmfta.org"">the National Motor Freight Traffic Association website</a>.</p>

<div class=""margin-bottom-30"">
<div class=""big-number margin-bottom-0"">50%</div>

<p class=""white-opaque"">At least half of a truck's fuel is used to overcome aerodynamic drag when traveling at highway speeds.</p>
</div>

<div class=""margin-bottom-30"">
<div class=""big-number margin-bottom-0"">14%</div>

<p class=""white-opaque"">Or more of a truck's fuel use can be offset by using the methods in this article.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Improving the aerodynamics of tractor-trailers has become a big issue in recent years. This is because heavy trucks burn a lot of diesel as they push up against air resistance. When an 18-wheeler travels on the highway, more than 50% of its fuel use goes toward reducing aerodynamic “drag.”</p>

<p>Cutting the drag on trucks will also cut down fuel consumption. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California is studying ways to improve the fuel economy of tractor-trailers. The lab’s researchers believe a combination of devices that improve truck aerodynamics could reduce trucking industry fuel consumption by 12%. That would equal more than $10 billion in diesel fuel savings per year.</p>

<h2>Streamlining Your Fleet</h2>

<p>What this means for your fleet is that adding the right aerodynamic devices can generate significant savings at the pump. Not all devices are equal in making the air smoother around a Class 8 rig as it barrels down the interstate. It is important to know what improvements reduce the most drag—and save the most fuel.</p>

<p>Four areas create the most aerodynamic drag on a tractor-trailer: the front of the tractor, the gap between the tractor and the trailer, the under-body of the trailer and the back of the trailer. Trucking companies added streamlined shields to the tops of truck cabs to save on gas after the oil embargos of the 1970s. In recent years, “side skirts” that reduce the air flow under trailers have become a common sight on the highway. Some trucking companies are now experimenting with devices that cut drag in the tractor-trailer gap and in the rear of the trailer.</p>
<?php echo file_get_contents(""sites/all/themes/rtsfinancial/images/aero-truck.svg""); ??>

<h2>Proven Methods</h2>

<p>Here are the most effective steps you can take to make your trucks more aerodynamic and fuel efficient, according to industry experts:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Narrow the Gap.</strong> Research shows that a gap of 18 inches or more between the tractor and trailer could lead to increased air resistance. Devices that completely cover the gap can reduce aerodynamic drag by as much as 6%. Several gap-fairing products on the market advertise fuel savings of 2% by narrowing the gap.

	<p> </p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>“Skirt” the Issue.</strong> Many trucking companies have adopted side skirts. By reducing the air underneath trailers, fuel savings of between 4% and 7% have been reported by side skirt manufacturers.
	<p> </p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Reduce Tail Winds.</strong> Wind tunnel and road tests show that adding a 24- to 32-inch “boat tail” can reduce turbulence behind a trailer’s square rear end. According to manufacturers, boat tails can save more than 6% on fuel for tractor-trailers traveling at 65 miles per hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other devices like wheel covers, slotted mud flaps and vortex generators lead to modest reductions in drag. These improvements alone do not lead to significant fuel savings.</p>

<h2>A Cumulative Effect</h2>

<p>Aerodynamic modifications add up to significant fuel savings when they are implemented together. Fleet owners who install gap fairings, side skirts and boat tails on their trucks can increase their fuel efficiency by 14% or more, according to industry sources. The cost of adding these devices is quickly offset by savings at the pump. A company that spends $1 million each year on fuel, for example, could expect to save more than $140,000 a year.</p>

<h2>Trucks of the Future</h2>

<p>For fleet owners with more money to spend, there are new, eco-friendly trucks coming to the market that offer streamlined bodies and big fuel savings. Airflow’s BulletTruck reportedly gets 13.4 miles to the gallon, while Peterbilt and Cummins Inc.’s SuperTruck has achieved 10.7 miles per gallon. These are both big improvements as most tractor-trailers on the road average about 6 miles per gallon.</p>

<p>Walmart has entered the game with its WAVE (Walmart Advanced Vehicle Experience) concept truck. The truck is reported to be 20% more aerodynamic than Walmart’s current fleet trucks. It also features a trailer made from carbon fiber that weighs about 4,000 pounds less than a conventional trailer.</p>

<p>These new trucks could represent as much as $20,000 in annual fuel savings per vehicle, according to some industry reports. They may arrive on the market just in time for new fuel regulations from Washington. The federal Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency are expected to toughen fuel efficiency standards on heavy trucks by the 2018 model year.</p>

<h2>Plenty of Room For More Carriers</h2>

<p>There are many benefits and challenges to starting your own trucking company. Whether you are a driver, a dispatcher, a fleet manager, or someone entirely new to the industry, you need good information on what it takes to start a successful trucking business today.</p>

<p>In addition to being the backbone of the U.S. economy, trucking is one of the country’s fastest-growing industries. A recent report by American Trucking Associations predicts that freight volumes will increase more than 36% over the next 11 years. At the same time, trucking continues to be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers. Some experts predict that an estimated national shortage of 48,000 drivers today could expand to more than 200,000 drivers in the next decade. The continued expansion of trucking freight, coupled with a growing shortage of trucking capacity, means there is plenty of room for new trucking carriers.</p>

<h2>How to Get Rolling</h2>

<p>There are many steps involved in gaining your authority and even more to consider before hauling your first load. Here is what you need to do to start your trucking company:</p>

<h3>Have a Business Plan</h3>

<p>Before gaining your authority, you need to establish some general goals for your trucking company. Where will your trucks operate? What industries will you serve and how will you adapt to downturns in the freight industry? Having a strategic plan for your company can spell the difference between success and failure in the highly competitive trucking industry.</p>

<h3>Legally Establish Your Company</h3>

<p>Like any other business, your trucking company is a legal entity. Determining your company’s legal name, structure, official identifications and tax reporting are all necessary steps to getting started.</p>

<h3>Acquire the Necessary Licenses and Permits</h3>

<p>Trucking is a heavily regulated industry that demands an entire checklist of permits and other requirements for a new trucking company. To gain your authority, you’ll need a commercial driver’s license, DOT and MC numbers, unified carrier registration, an international registration plan, an IFTA decal and a BOC-3 form. There are even more regulatory requirements if you plan to haul government or international loads.</p>

<h3>Secure Trucking Insurance</h3>

<p>Finding the right insurance is critical in a high-risk industry like trucking. There are two basic types of insurance—employer insurance and commercial business insurance. It is wise to carry both forms of insurance to make sure your trucking company has enough coverage.</p>

<h3>Look for Fuel Discounts</h3>

<p>Diesel fuel makes up 34% of operating expenses, on average, for trucking fleets. Finding a reliable fuel card and other discount programs can give your new trucking business a head start financially.</p>

<p>Your company needs to make money. That's a given. Determining profitability for trucking companies, however, can be a complicated process. As your company grows, it becomes crucial to regularly track how much money is coming in and how much is going out. Calculating revenue and profit per mile is the key to understanding your company’s overall financial health.</p>

<p>Your first step is to carefully track your expenses. You can learn more on how to do that by reading our article, <a href=""http://rtsfinancial.com/guides/trucking-calculations-formulas"">“How to Calculate Cost per Mile for Your Trucking Company.”</a> Once you have a handle on cost per mile, you can examine your company’s revenue. Subtracting cost per mile from revenue per mile will determine the net profit (or loss) of every mile your trucks drive. Accounting software such as <a href=""http://www.quickbooks.com"">QuickBooks</a>, <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com/"">FreshBooks</a> and <a href=""http://www.xero.com/"">Xero</a> can help you make these calculations for less than $20 per month. If you have specific questions about calculating revenue and profit per mile for your company, it is also a good idea to consult a certified public accountant.</p>

<p>The following sections use fictional charts to illustrate revenue and profit per mile. These charts serve as examples that may not reflect all your company’s income and profitability. The final section addresses how you can use this information to build a sustainable, growing business.</p>

<h2>Revenue per Mile</h2>

<p>Revenue per mile determines how much money your company is generating for the services it provides.</p>

<p>In the chart below, the fictional company <strong>Chuck’s Trucks Inc.</strong> calculates revenue by the mile for the month of August. The chart divides the revenue by the 10,000 miles Chuck’s Trucks drove that month:</p>

<p><strong>Chuck’s Trucks Revenue for August</strong></p>

			<td width=""150"">10,000</td>
			<td width=""150"">$1.35</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h2>Profit per Mile</h2>

<p>In our <a href=""http://rtsfinancial.com/guides/trucking-calculations-formulas"">article examining cost per mile</a>, Chuck’s Trucks added all of its fixed costs, variable costs and salary expenses for August. That added up to a total cost per mile of $1.098 for the month. To determine the company’s profit per mile, subtract the cost per mile from the revenue per mile:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue ($1.35 per mile) – Cost ($1.098 per mile) = Profit ($0.25 per mile)</strong></p>

<p>In the month of August, Chuck’s Trucks posted a per-mile profit of 25 cents. That amounts to a healthy 19% profit margin on the $1.35 per mile in revenue.</p>

<h2>How This Helps Your Business</h2>

<p>Knowledge is power in the fast-changing trucking industry. You need to identify what markets to serve and which lanes that will generate the most revenue. It is equally crucial to know how much money your trucking company needs to charge in order to post a profit. Understanding how to calculate cost, revenue and profit per mile arms you with information you need to successfully negotiate rates with shippers and brokers.</p>

<p>While the example of Chuck’s Trucks focuses only on the month of August, you need to know your company’s financial position over the course of several months. Industry factors like seasonal demand, weather conditions, fluctuating fuel prices and deadheading miles all need to be taken into account. For example, your company might have operated at a loss in January and February due to maintenance costs and severe weather. That means you need to adjust your rates for the summer months to ensure your company makes up for those losses.</p>

<p>There are several aspects to financial management for your trucking company. It all starts with knowing what it takes to be profitable. Calculating cost, revenue and profit per mile is a key step to putting your trucking company on the road to success.</p>

412,0,Blog Posts,Accounting Software for Trucking Companies,Accounting Software for Trucking Companies,"<p>Many small trucking companies still use ledgers, spreadsheets and file drawers when managing their financials. If your company falls into that category, there are easy ways to do accounting without all the paperwork. Online accounting software allows you to update and track your financials in real-time for as little as $10 a month.</p>

<p>There are many accounting software products on the market today that are aimed at small businesses. There are even software platforms with technology tailored for trucking companies. Popular software products like QuickBooks and Xero are cloud-based, meaning you can access your accounting data at any time from a smartphone, laptop computer or tablet. Many of these products include phone apps that you can download from Google Play or Apple’s App Store.</p>

<p>The advantage of using general accounting software like QuickBooks, Xero or FreshBooks is that the accounting functions are more advanced and user-friendly. The advantage of using accounting software designed for trucking companies is the ability to perform fleet-specific functions like load tracking, settlements and IFTA tax reporting.</p>

<p>What follows is a directory of industry-leading accounting software applications as well as five leading software products specifically for trucking companies:</p>

<h2>QuickBooks</h2>

<p>Intuit-owned <a href=""http://www.quickbooks.com"">QuickBooks</a> is the U.S. market leader in accounting software. The cloud-based version of QuickBooks was redesigned in 2013 to make it easier to use on a smartphone or tablet. QuickBooks can sync your finances and account information across all your devices, including the iPad, iPhone and Android. The app provides real-time payables, receivables, and cash flow, and prepares your data for tax time. The QuickBooks dashboard’s color-coded approach makes it easy to track open invoices, overdue bills and your overall cash balance. QuickBooks also allows you to personalize and send your invoices from anywhere at any time, and it deposits money into your bank account when you get paid.</p>

<p>With QuickBooks, you can expand your mobile reach through integration with other Intuit products, as well as more than 90 third-party business apps.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> QuickBooks allows a free, month-long trial period to try the software. Subscriptions start at $10 per month for small businesses, or $5 per month for an individual contractor. The most popular package, QuickBooks Essentials, costs $21 per month. The premium QuickBooks Plus product includes inventory tracking and tax preparation, and costs $28 per month.</p>

<p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> QuickBooks Accounting+Invoice has more than a million installs on the Google Play Store. More than 16,000 users have reviewed the app, giving it an average rating of 4.3 out of five stars. QuickBooks is available to download on Google Play and iTunes.</p>

<h2>Xero</h2>

<p>New Zealand-based <a href=""http://www.xero.com"">Xero</a> is aiming to replace QuickBooks as the top accounting software for U.S. businesses. Unlike QuickBooks, Xero was developed with mobile devices in mind. The Xero Touch application works with iPhone, iPad & Android. Xero offers real-time tracking of accounting transactions and customizable invoices that customers can pay digitally. The software’s account reconciling feature is easy to use and allows you to perform what was once a time-consuming task within minutes. Xero also integrates with more than 300 third-party business apps. That flexibility lets you consolidate your company’s accounting with project management and client relationship data.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Like QuickBooks, Xero offers a free, one-month trial. The software’s Starter package is $27.50 per month with a limited amount of invoicing, billing and bank transaction reconciling. The standard package allows unlimited transactions and costs $55 per month. The premium package offers payroll for as many as 200 employees and costs $70 per month.</p>

<p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Xero Accounting has more than 100,000 installs on Google Play. The app has been reviewed by more than 1,700 users, who give it an average rating of 3.6 stars. Xero can be downloaded from Google Play and iTunes.</p>

<h2>FreshBooks</h2>

<p>One of the advantages <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com"">FreshBooks</a> presents is that it can show exactly when a client has viewed your digital invoice. This capability eliminates the common customer excuse about “not receiving the invoice.” Like other online accounting software, FreshBooks allows you to customize invoices and lets your customers pay digitally. With the mobile app, you can record billable hours on your device or smart phone. You can also snap a photo of a receipt with your phone, and it will be added to your company’s expenses. FreshBooks is available on iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> FreshBooks offers a free, 30-day trial period. Pricing starts at $15 per month with a package that accommodates as many as five customers and unlimited invoices. FreshBooks’ Plus package is $25 per month and allows billing for up to 50 clients. The Premium package is $50 per month and lets you bill as many as 500 clients.</p>

<p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> The FreshBooks Classic accounting app has been installed by more than 100,000 users on Google Play. The app has received more than 1,700 reviews, with an overall rating of 4.2 out of five stars. You can download FreshBooks from Google Play or iTunes.</p>

<h2>RigBooks</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.rigbooks.com"">RigBooks</a> comes in four different packages geared toward companies that operate between one and five trucks. The basic package covers profits and costs without specifics on loads, customers or vendors. RigBook’s more sophisticated, “Small Fleet” software allows companies to perform invoicing, track loads, prepare IFTA taxes and coordinate multiple trucks. RigBooks is online software, meaning it can be used on a computer, tablet or smartphone.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> RigBooks does not share pricing information on its website, but it does offer a free, 30-day trial.</p>

413,0,Blog Posts,Diversifying Your Trucking Company's Customer Base ,Diversifying Your Trucking Company's Customer Base ,"<p>Having customers that you trust is a good thing. Depending on one or two of them for most of your business, however, can be risky.</p>

<p>Relying on just a couple of shippers for your loads means tying your fate to the success or failure of those customers. What happens if one of them switches to a different trucker, defaults on payments, or goes out of business? Suddenly your company is scrambling to replace more than 50 percent of its revenues and struggling to keep its own doors open.</p>

<p>Such dependency, or “client concentration,” is found among businesses in all industries. It is common among small to mid-sized carriers that find a customer they trust and build on that relationship. That approach is especially risky in an uncertain economy. Some companies that rely heavily on a single customer have been known to go out of business because of one payment default.</p>

<p>Below are a few steps your company can take to avoid the risk of high client concentration:</p>

<h2><strong>Continuously add new customers</strong></h2>

<p>You should constantly strive to diversify your book of business. A good goal is to establish a portfolio in which no single customer makes up more than 20 percent of total revenues. Access to online load boards as well as freight brokers that are connected with thousands of shipping clients make adding new customers less cumbersome than ever before.</p>

<h2><strong>Keep a close eye on existing customers</strong></h2>

<p>Tracking your customers’ payment patterns and credit scores is another way to maintain a healthy book of business. Some factoring companies provide credit ratings and analysis on many shippers and brokers. This arms you with critical information when deciding whether or not to take on new business with a customer.</p>

<h2><strong>Keep your balance</strong> </h2>

<p>It is important to regularly assess the diversity of your business portfolio. Is your company becoming overly reliant on a particular customer or industry? Carve out some time each month or quarter to analyze your book of business and identify any possible risks.</p>

<h2><strong>Capitalize on a carrier-friendly market</strong></h2>

<p>One trend that may help you build a more diverse customer base is a lingering shortage of qualified drivers. Some industry sources estimate that shortage to be as many as 30,000 drivers throughout the United States. The opportunities to pick up new clients should be more plentiful as the economy continues to rebound.</p>

</div>

<p>Running a trucking company without knowing your costs is like driving with your eyes closed.</p>

<p>If you do not know the cost of each mile your trucks drive, you cannot know the best per-mile rate to charge your shippers. This makes it difficult to post a profit.</p>

<p>Carriers that do not track and control their operating expenses may soon go out of business. Nationally, 310 carriers with five or more trucks were forced to shut down in 2015. Trucking is a tough market and poor bookkeeping hurts a company’s chances of survival.</p>

<p>To ensure accuracy in calculating your costs per mile, you must account for your company’s expenses. These expenses fall under three categories: fixed costs, variable costs and salaries. Omit just one cost of doing business from your calculations and you will not have a complete picture of your company’s bottom line. If you do not use accounting software, products such as <a href=""http://www.quickbooks.com"">QuickBooks</a>, <a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com/"">FreshBooks</a> and <a href=""http://www.xero.com/"">Xero</a> can help report all of your costs for less than $20 per month. If you have specific questions about calculating cost per mile, it is also a good idea to consult a certified public accountant.</p>

<p>The following sections use fictional charts to illustrate each cost category. These charts serve as examples that may not reflect all of your company’s expenses. The final section brings all the costs together to calculate a company’s total cost per mile.</p>

<h2>Fixed Costs</h2>

<p>Fixed costs are expenses that your company incurs whether your trucks are hauling a load or are in the parking lot. Fixed costs include expenses like insurance, property leases, permits and other services.</p>

<p>In the chart below, the fictional company <strong>Chuck’s Trucks Inc.</strong> calculates fixed costs by the mile for the month of August. The chart divides each fixed cost by the 10,000 miles that Chuck’s Trucks drove that month:</p>

<h3>Chuck’s Trucks Fixed Costs for August</h3>

			<td><strong>Total Fixed Costs</strong></td>
			<td>$3,570</td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Variable Costs</h2>

<p>Variable costs are the money that your company spends in operating its trucks. These costs include fuel, maintenance, repairs, meals, lodging and other expenses incurred on the road. Variable costs can range greatly from one time period to the next. As you put more mileage on your trucks, you will see the variable costs increase. You should calculate these costs monthly to get the most up-to-date information on how much your company is spending.</p>

<p>Here is how Chuck’s Trucks calculated variable costs. Again, the costs are divided by the 10,000 miles the company drove in August.</p>

			<td><strong>Total Variable Costs</strong></td>
			<td>$3,665</td>
			<td>$0.3665</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Salary</h2>

<p>The amount you pay your drivers is likely your single biggest expense. It needs to be part of your calculation of cost-per-mile. Here is what it looked like for Chuck’s Trucks in August:</p>

<table cellpadding=""15"">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th> </th>
			<th><strong>Monthly Cost</strong></th>
			<th><strong>Per-Mile Cost</strong></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Drivers’ Salaries</td>
			<td>$3,750</td>
			<td>$0.375</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Total Cost per Mile</h2>

<p>To determine the total monthly cost per mile, simply add the fixed, variable and salary costs. Here is the total cost per mile for the fictional Chuck’s Trucks in the month of August:</p>

<table cellpadding=""15"">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th><strong>Cost Per Mile</strong></th>
			<th> </th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Fixed Costs</td>
			<td>$0.357</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Variable Costs</td>
			<td>$0.3665</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Driver Salaries</td>
			<td>$0.375</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Total Cost</td>
			<td>$1.098</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Knowing your trucking company’s cost per mile benefits you in many ways. It helps identify spending patterns and areas where you can cut back if needed. Cost per mile also allows you to determine an appropriate per-mile rate to charge shippers. Knowing your company’s operating expenses on a per-mile basis gives you the information needed to be profitable.</p>

<p>If your cost per mile seems high, one solution is to take on more work. Not only will this increase revenue, but your cost per mile should decrease. While your variable costs may increase from taking on more work, the fixed costs will remain the same. Here is a fictional illustration of how increased mileage can decrease the cost per mile:</p>

<table cellpadding=""15"">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th><strong>Miles</strong></th>
			<th><strong>Cost Per Mile</strong></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>10,000</td>
			<td>$1.09</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>15,000</td>
			<td>$0.95</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>20,000</td>
			<td>$0.85</td>
		</tr>

415,0,Blog Posts,Fuel Discounts and Other Ways to Save Money,Fuel Discounts and Other Ways to Save Money,"<p>Booking loads is just one part of operating a successful trucking fleet. The other part is controlling costs. When starting your own company, you need to take advantage of every available opportunity to save money on your expenses.</p>

<p>One of your first steps should be to sign your fleet up for a fuel card. In addition to saving you money at the pump, many fuel cards offer discounts on other products and services that trucking companeis rely on. </p>

<h3><big>Better Savings and More Control </big></h3>

<p>Fuel cards were created years ago by gas station and travel center chains as a way to build customer loyalty and sell more gallons at the pump. They rewarded that loyalty by offering per-gallon discounts at all retail locations. Trucking companies quickly recognized fuel cards as a way to save a considerable amount of money on their fuel consumption. Issuing fuel cards to drivers was also an effective way to control and monitor their spending. Previously, fleet managers would give their drivers an unrestricted credit card or even a wad of cash to use on the road. That approach made it easy for drivers to fudge on paying for their expenses. </p>

<p>Today, fuel cards are more sophisticated, with several national brands offering discounts and prepayment options across a wide range of retail partners. The availability of real-time data also enables your fuel card provider to give you regular updates on diesel prices at locations throughout the country, helping you to find the lowest possible fuel prices every time. </p>

<p>Put simply, owning a fuel card should mean never having to pay full price at the diesel pump again. Finding the right card for your fleet does require a little shopping around. Fuel discounts can vary greatly. Over the course of a year, a discount of even a few cents per gallon can potentially save your fleet thousands of dollars on fuel.  </p>

<h3><big>Fuel Savings at More Than 1,100 Locations</big></h3>

<p><strong>RTS Carrier Services </strong>is one of the fastest-growing fuel savings programs in the country, offering discounts at more than a thousand locations nationwide. In addition to substantial savings at 650 Pilot Flying J travel centers, RTS Carrier Services’ exclusive Plus Network includes discounts with more than 540 other fuel stations. CarrierPro, an exclusive website and mobile app, helps drivers find the best estimated fuel prices and amenities across the entire RTS Carrier Services Fuel Network.</p>

<p>Designed to set the standard for savings and success in the trucking industry, RTS Carrier Services also offers its members access to PlusCheks and credit lines of as much as $2,500 per truck, per week. The new Shop Program provides discounts on maintenance and DOT inspections at 40 Boss Shop locations nationwide.

<p>It is a well-known fact in the trucking industry that prices on diesel fuel are different in each state and often in each city. You may wonder why fuel prices vary so greatly by region or section of the country. Taxes are a major reason, but there are other factors as well.</p>

<p>Below are five key reasons why fuel prices can be vastly different from one stop to the next along your route:</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>

<p>The biggest reason for the variance in fuel prices is that states tax gasoline at different rates. The rate often depends on how much money each state needs to raise in highway funding. Other issues like emissions regulations play a role as well.</p>

<p>According to the American Petroleum Institute, California this year has the highest rate at 106.1 cents per diesel gallon in combined state and federal taxes, followed by Pennsylvania at 99.5 cents. The state with the lowest tax rate is Alaska, at 36.7 cents per diesel gallon.</p>

<h2>Emissions Standards</h2>

<p>Refineries throughout the United States have to create more than 50 blends of gas to meet different city and state standards. Many cities and states require cleaner-burning fuel that emits less pollution into the environment. Producing so many different fuel grades adds operating cost to refineries and distributors. That cost is passed along to consumers and carriers.</p>

<p>Chicago has some of the strictest fuel emissions standards in the country and is often the city with the most expensive fuel prices. Cities with fewer restrictions like Charleston, S.C. often rank among areas in the U.S. with the cheapest fuel.</p>

<h2>Crude Oil Prices</h2>

<p>The price of fuel often reflects the level of oil production and the challenge in transporting crude oil from its drilling source to a refinery.</p>

<p>Today the oil drilling business is booming again, as U.S. oil production has surged to levels not seen since the early 1970s. Therefore, the price of crude oil is cheaper in states where it is produced or refined like Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Louisiana. However, other areas of the country do not have access to that oil. Fuel prices and taxes tend to be steeper in areas like the Northeast and West Coast, which rely more on imported oil.</p>

<h2>Pipelines</h2>

<p>The nation’s pipeline infrastructure is the most effective way to transport crude oil from drillers to refineries. Until recently, the pipelines have lacked capacity to serve domestic fuel production, which contributes to the variances in diesel prices.</p>

<p>That challenge is now being addressed. In 2014, TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone Pipeline opened its south leg between Oklahoma and Texas. That leg can pump as much as 800,000 gallons of crude oil a day to refineries along the Gulf Coast. The pipeline has helped even out fuel prices between the country’s geographic center and the coasts.</p>

<p>TransCanada plans to begin work in 2019 on its new Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline, which was first proposed in 2008, would ship 830,000 barrels of crude per day from Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota, to Nebraska. From there, it would connect with Keystone’s south leg, carrying crude to the Gulf Coast refineries.</p>

<p>Environmentalists and other groups strongly opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, so there could be more delays to its development. However, TransCanada has announced it has enough commitments from oil producers now to build the new pipeline.</p>

<h2>Supply and Demand</h2>

<p>Fuel prices are affected by various market factors that include refinery maintenance, the switch-over to summer blend gas and fluctuations in consumer demand. In most states, fuel consumption peaks in the summer travel months of July and August and is lower during the winter months.</p>

417,0,Blog Posts,Flexible but Firm: Credit Policies That Work for You and the Customer,Flexible but Firm: Credit Policies That Work for You and the Customer,"<p>A common mistake many business owners make is counting receivables as cash. It is important to remember that the invoice is worthless until the customer pays it. You need that payment as soon as possible for your company to meet its goals.</p>

<p>That is why it is crucial to have a credit policy in place that you and your customers can follow. The terms and conditions you establish for providing services on credit will drive how quickly and consistently you can turn your invoices into revenue. Here are a few things to consider when drafting your credit policy:</p>

<h2>Know your company</h2>

<p>The policy’s terms should reflect your company’s values, financial state and goals. How much do you want to generate in sales each year? How much liquidity does your company have and what is your capacity for taking on higher-risk customers? Who are your competitors? How aggressively do you want to capture market share?</p>

<p>The ideal credit policy will support the values and ideals of your company without hampering your ability to land sales or break into new markets. It will be flexible enough for your business to land clients, but firm enough to ensure steady cash flow and only calculated risks. If you have a larger company, make sure all your department heads have a say in drafting the policy and are comfortable with what it communicates.</p>

<h2>Know your numbers</h2>

<p>How long can your company afford to wait on a payment? How much cash do you have on hand, and is it enough to take on higher-risk customers? Understanding how cash flows through your company and how much money you need to operate will inform your payment terms. A <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-cash-flow-budget-and-why-do-you-need-one"">cash flow budget or forecast</a> is also a great tool for understanding your company’s finances and how soon you will need customers to pay.</p>

<h2>Understand your customers</h2>

<p>Before taking on a new customer, check that company’s credit score and payment history. Do some online research to see if they have any liens, active lawsuits or bankruptcy filings. You can also create a formal credit application that asks the company to provide business references, bank contacts and financial statements. If a customer tends to pay late or if the work involves expensive labor or equipment, you might adjust terms to require a partial payment before the work begins.</p>

<p>An effective credit policy should reflect your customers’ unique challenges and pain points, as well as the industry standards in extending credit. A strict policy may benefit your company’s cash flow. It may also hurt your sales if the terms are too demanding. Conversely, more lenient terms may lead to more sales, but also greater risk.</p>

<h2>Be aggressive</h2>

<p>The payment cycle for many industries is “net 30 days,” which means a customer’s payment is due within 30 days after a product or service is delivered. However, that does not mean that some customers will not agree to a shorter payment cycle. Test a new customer’s flexibility when negotiating terms. If you suggest payment in 10 to 15 days and the customer agrees, you may gain several valuable days for your cash flow.</p>

<h2>Throw in some incentives</h2>

<p>Consider rewarding early customer payments with a clause that extends a small discount. You might offer a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days. Likewise, you can discourage late payments by assessing late charges or carrying charges after 30 days. If you are performing a large project for a customer, you may structure the terms to ensure a steady flow of payments. For instance, delivering 10,000 units of a product for a one-time payment may exhaust your company’s cash flow and resources. Instead, you could agree to five deliveries of 2,000 units with payment due after each delivery.</p>

<h2>Expect late payments</h2>

<p>Despite your best efforts, some customers will not follow your payment terms. Big companies tend to pay late because they have enormous leverage over smaller vendors. A 2012 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> survey found that 64% of small businesses had at least some invoices that went unpaid for 60 days. A study of more than 12 million invoices by Xerox found that invoices are paid an average of two weeks late. Late payments happen to everyone. In crafting your payment terms, take the worst-case scenario into account. If a company has a history of paying two weeks days late, set your terms for 10 to 15 days. That way, you stand a better chance of receiving your cash in 30 days.</p>

<h2>Communicate your terms</h2>

<p>One effective way to speed up your cash conversion cycle is to negotiate payment terms with customers before you work with them. Of course, you want to negotiate terms that are as favorable as possible to your company. Include all of your payment terms and conditions on the credit application. This will ensure that a customer has read and agreed to them. Terms can also be repeated on orders, invoices and even emails related to the customer’s account.</p>

<h2>Enforce your policy</h2>

<p>In managing receivables, outline a process for following up on accounts that are not paid in time. Develop schedules for sending out invoices and following up with collection letters and phone calls. Have a plan to reach out to the customer before an invoice becomes due, especially for larger accounts. This effort may seem like a headache, but it can save precious days for your cash conversion cycle.

<p>Studies show that, for every dollar the average American trucking company earns, it spends 95.2 cents on operating costs. That leaves a profit of only 4.8 cents. With such a thin margin to work with, trucking fleets need to save money wherever they can, particularly on diesel fuel. Membership to a fleet fuel card can help generate those savings for carriers of any size.</p>

<p>You have likely heard many things about fuel cards from people in the trucking industry. Before deciding what <a href=""/product/fuel-discount-program"">kind of card is right for your fleet</a>, you will want to understand how fuel cards are structured and operate, as well as the benefits they can provide.</p>

<p>Below are answers to some common questions about fuel cards and how they work.</p>

<h2>Who Uses Fuel Cards?</h2>

<p>The typical customer for a fleet fuel card is an over-the-road trucking company that buys diesel at truck stops for class 7 and 8 commercial trucks. Fuel cards are designed to benefit carriers that range in size from a single rig to hundreds of trucks. Fuel card customers include contracted carriers, private fleets, less-than-truckload carriers and independent owner/operators.</p>

<h2>How a Fuel Card Can Help Your Trucking Company</h2>

<div class=""video-content"">

</div>

<h2>How Does a Carrier Benefit?</h2>

<p>A good fuel card program offers carriers significant per-gallon discounts on diesel, as well as savings on other services.</p>

<p>Fuel cards are basically partnerships that are designed to drive sales for fuel station merchants. When a fuel card provider sends its members to partnering truck stops or fuel stops, it receives a cut, usually 2% to 3%, of the fuel sales. To drive more of the fuel card’s members to their fuel stops, the merchants offer exclusive discounts off the per-gallon price. These discounts may be different at each fuel stop location and can change daily, based on fuel prices and settlement rates between the merchant and the fuel card company.</p>

<p>As a carrier, you want a fuel card that consistently offers strong savings on diesel at locations along the lanes your company runs. Finding a card program that offers the right blend of discounts and flexibility can help your fleet save thousands of dollars a year on fuel.</p>

</div>

<h2>How Are Fuel Savings Calculated?</h2>

<p>Per-gallon fuel discounts are negotiated between the merchant and the fuel card company. There are two models of savings offered by most fuel card companies: “retail-minus,” and “cost-plus.”</p>

<p>Retail-minus is exactly what it sounds like. A certain amount of money is deducted from the per-gallon retail price of fuel. That savings is passed along to the fuel card customer.</p>

<p>Cost-plus is a little more complicated. An independent agency called the Oil Pricing Information Service (OPIS) determines the base or “rack” price of fuel for each location. Added to the base price are taxes and transportation costs. The “plus” comes in when other fees are added. The cost-plus model is often cheaper than “retail-minus” in parts of the country like California and Hawaii where the cost of transporting fuel to merchants is more expensive.</p>

<p>Some fuel cards offer fleets a “better of” option. With each fuel purchase, the card will automatically select which of the two pricing models provides the most savings. That way, fleets and drivers do not have to worry about switching back and forth between retail-minus and cost-plus. With “better of,” fleets will always get the best available pricing.</p>

<h2>What Happens When You Swipe the Card?</h2>

<p>Some fuel card companies charge a small, fixed transaction fee each time your fleet uses the card to purchase diesel. Depending on where you fuel up and what card you are using, your savings may be immediate or sent to you in a check later in the month.</p>

<p>Some merchants provide point-of-sale discounts, meaning the cost of fuel is reduced at the point of settlement. The fleet pays the reduced cost to the fuel card company and the fuel card company pays the reduced cost to the merchant.</p>

<p>Other merchants prefer a rebate model. That means the full cost of fuel is billed to the fleet at retail. The fleet receives a check at the end of the month for the total amount of money discounted from the fuel purchases. The rebate model can sometimes confuse drivers who fuel up, see the full retail price on their receipt and do not think that they are receiving the discount.</p>

<h2>What are Some Other Reasons to Use a Fuel Card?</h2>

<p>Beyond saving money on diesel purchases, a fuel card offers several other advantages. They include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Spending Control.</strong> Many fuel cards provide weekly credit lines and PlusCheks that drivers can use to pay for expenses on the road. Each fleet can limit and monitor the amount of money that drivers spend with the fuel card, reducing the chance of fraud. This is a far safer approach than giving drivers an unrestricted credit card or a wad of cash to use on the road.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Fleet Management.</strong> Some fuel cards provide fleets with online accounts that contain real-time, detailed reporting on all transactions. You can customize these reports to identify which drivers are spending the most on fuel, what retailers offer the best deals and how you can operate your fleet more efficiently. You can monitor, score and compare drivers’ behavior, and pinpoint routes and fuel stops that offer the most fuel savings for your trucking fleet. The data you collect from your fuel card account can also help with your fleet’s quarterly IFTA filings.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Communication.</strong> With the daily fluctuations in fuel prices, it is important to have a fuel card company that regularly communicates the latest fuel discounts throughout its retail network. Some fuel cards have mobile apps you can access on your smartphone or tablet to find the lowest fuel prices across the country. This saves you time in planning your routes and eliminates paying too much at the pump.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Other Savings.</strong> While saving money on diesel is usually the main draw to using a fuel card program, many programs offer other ways to save as well. Depending on the fuel card, trucking companies may also receive discounts on maintenance, tires, repairs, document scanning, lodging and other common expenses of operating a trucking company.</p>

419,0,Blog Posts,The Six Most Common Myths about Factoring,The Six Most Common Myths about Factoring,"<p>Factoring helps thousands of companies improve their financial situations each day. Yet some business owners have a negative perception about factoring their invoices.</p>

<p>There is a lot of misinformation about factoring, even though the financing of receivables has been around for centuries and is practiced in many industries. Below are six myths that cause some companies to shy away from factoring, even when doing so might stall their growth and financial performance:</p>

<h2>Myth #1: Factoring is only meant for small, start-up companies.</h2>

<p>Advancing cash on unpaid invoices is a proven way for a start-up company to grow at a faster pace. However, many older, mid-sized companies factor as well. The reasons are simple: factoring is quick, inexpensive and does not require a cumbersome approval process.</p>

<p>Some companies factor their invoices during the start-up phase, shift to a line of credit with a bank, then they go back to factoring. Why do they return? Unlike a traditional bank loan, factoring can scale up to match a company’s growth. A solid, reputable factoring provider can finance tens of millions of dollars in monthly invoices for companies of all sizes.</p>

<h2>Myth #2: All factoring companies are the same.</h2>

<p>This might be the greatest misunderstanding of all. Hundreds of factoring companies operate today in the United States. Some of those factors provide poor customer service, outdated technology, and lock clients into unfavorable agreements. Most factors, however, want to build long-term relationships with their clients and provide the most competitive services possible.</p>

<p>As in any industry, some factoring companies are better than others. If you are interested in factoring receivables, you need to put some time and research into finding the best factor possible for your business.</p>

<h2>Myth #3: Factoring is expensive.</h2>

<p>A common knock on factoring is that it costs more than the interest rate on a loan. That may or may not be true, depending on who handles the factoring. Some factoring companies charge various administrative fees that can add up to more than 5% of an invoice value. However, most factors offer fees that are competitive with bank loan rates, depending on the client’s monthly invoice volume.</p>

<p>As with any other service, it pays to shop around before selecting a factoring company. You should also be assertive in negotiating your factoring fees to a level that meets your business goals.</p>

<h2>Myth #4: You have to factor every single one of your invoices.</h2>

<p>This is largely false. When you enter into an agreement with a factoring company, the factor will expect a consistent, continuous flow of invoices from your business.</p>

<p>However, few factoring companies require their clients to factor all of their invoices. Many companies choose to factor invoices from certain customers. These could be customers that make up a large portion of the company’s business or tend to wait longer to pay. The back-office services that factors can provide—from credit checks to collections support—give clients an advantage in getting quicker payments from the customers that fuel their business.</p>

<h2>Myth #5: Factoring is a last resort for struggling companies.</h2>

<p>Factoring is an accessible form of financing because it relies on the creditworthiness of a company’s customers, not the credit score of the company itself. That leads some people to believe than factoring is the desperate domain of either start-ups or businesses on the verge of closing their doors. That could not be further from the truth.</p>

<p>Factors do help distressed companies, but they also want to work with clients that are successful and plan on growing at a rapid pace. As mentioned above, many established business owners could secure a line of credit with a lender but choose the flexibility of factoring instead.</p>

<h2>Myth #6: Factoring agreements are inflexible and long-term.</h2>

<p>Some factoring companies lock their clients into contracts that include fixed rates, termination fees and terms as long as two years. However, most reputable factors provide more flexibility than that. Fees and rates can be adjusted as a client builds more monthly factoring volume. Termination or buyout fees are usually moderate, and the term of an agreement may be six months to a year.</p>

<p>There can be advantages to signing up for a longer term with a factoring company. Most factors will offer lower fees and more competitive rates if a client signs a one-year agreement as opposed to a one-month term. The best factoring companies understand that providing a high level of customer service is the best strategy for retaining clients. At the same time, adjustable rates provide an incentive for clients to factor more of their invoices.</p>

Here are some of the most common misconceptions.","<a href=""/users/wjorgensen"">28</a>",wjorgensen,1547962047,1667245462,0,/articles/six-most-common-myths-about-factoring,1,1,0
421,0,Blog Posts,The Difference Between Recourse and Non-Recourse Factoring,The Difference Between Recourse and Non-Recourse Factoring,"<p>There are multiple benefits to factoring your invoices, most important being that factoring helps you increase your cash flow for things like payroll, operating expenses, taking on new business and more. Additionally, a factoring company will provide back-office support by managing your collections on any invoices you've submitted for factoring. But what happens if a customer's client (called a debtor) does not pay one of those invoices? The outcome of this situation will depend on the type of factoring agreement you have with the factoring company. </p>

<h2>Two Types of Factoring</h2>

<p>There are two main types of factoring - recourse and non-recourse. Recourse factoring is the most common and means that your company must buy back any invoices that the factoring company is unable to collect payment on. You are ultimately responsible for any non-payment. </p>

<p>Non-recourse factoring means the factoring company assumes most of the risk of non-payment by your customers. Non-recourse does not necessarily protect your company from all risk, though. There are usually stipulations associated with non-recourse factoring, and the situations in which you are not responsible for customer non-payment are very specific.</p>

<p>For example, many factoring companies offer non-recourse that only applies if a debtor declares bankruptcy. And they will limit non-recourse agreements to debtors that have a good credit rating, meaning the debtors bad credits ratings (who are at the highest risk of non-payment) aren't even eligible for non-recourse. Because non-recourse agreements typically have a higher factoring rate (sometimes by a full percentage), it's important to determine whether the higher rate is really worth the cost.</p>

<h2>Understanding Terms</h2>

<p>Whether your company plans to pursue recourse or non-recourse factoring, it is important to sit down with a reputable factoring company to discuss their terms. It may be to your advantage to find a factor that offers both recourse and non-recourse factoring. A factoring company with a strong credit team can also help you avoid working with customers that have poor payment histories.</p>

<p>Regardless of the type of account, a good factor will always make a diligent effort to collect on your invoices. Collection calls from the factor to a debtor should start 40 days after the invoice was sent and continue for several weeks. After 90 days, the factor may “recourse” the invoice back to you. The factor should, however, provide options for helping you cover the cost. The factor may withhold a portion of future cash advances or deduct cash from your reserve account. Working out an unpaid invoice should not cause your company financial hardship, as it isn't in the best interest for you or your factor. </p>

<p>The best option is for your company to have customers with good credit and solid payment histories. This enables you to pay lower fees for recourse factoring without worrying about the risk.</p>

422,0,Blog Posts,Why Leasing Might Be the Best Way to Build Your Fleet,Why Leasing Might Be the Best Way to Build Your Fleet,"<p>Buying is better than renting. That is what most of us are taught, whether it involves a home, a vehicle or a piece of equipment. </p>

<p>That belief may be outdated in the trucking world. Many large trucking fleets today are upgrading their aging fleets with newer trucks and equipment. That increased demand, along with stricter emissions standards, continue to make it more expensive to buy new or used big rigs. The average resale price of most commercial trucks ranges from $41,900 to $69,600, according to a 2015 report by EquipmentWatch Intelligence.   </p>

<p>Adding trucks and equipment to your new fleet through leasing or rental agreements might make better sense for your company’s bottom line. Here are four reasons why:</p>

<h2>Less Expense </h2>

<p>Leasing allows you to save cash and apply it to other parts of your business. There is no down payment with leasing, and your monthly payments may be deductible from taxable income. Leasing a truck or equipment also spares you the time and energy of seeking a line of credit to finance a purchase. Finally, you can often acquire a newer, more expensive truck through a lease agreement instead of buying it. </p>

<h2>Greater Flexibility </h2>

<p>About 85% of small- to mid-sized businesses lease equipment, according to GE Capital. These companies realize that they can be more profitable by operating machinery instead of owning. Leasing also provides greater flexibility in case of an unforeseen expense or an economic downturn. </p>

<p>For your trucking company, short-term leases allow you to expand and contract your fleet as the market requires. You can also use leases to determine if new equipment is a good fit for your company before you invest in a long-term commitment. </p>

<h2>Low Maintenance </h2>

<p>A drawback to owning trucks or anything else is that you are responsible for their upkeep. Breakdowns in your fleet can lead to unexpected expenses and interruptions to your business. If you lease your vehicles, the leasing company can take care of the maintenance.  </p>

<h2>No Resale </h2>

<p>Trucks and equipment depreciate in value as they age and take on wear-and-tear. When you own assets that you no longer need, you have to figure out how to sell them. You will likely have to sell them at a much lower price than you paid to acquire them. Negotiating a competitive lease rate up-front on trucks and equipment eases the worry of depreciation. It also spares you the time and effort of finding a buyer, or disposing of the equipment later on. <em> </em></p>

423,0,Blog Posts,Finding the Right Insurance for Your Trucking Company,Finding the Right Insurance for Your Trucking Company,"<p>Because of the risks and responsibilities that come with operating heavy trucks, it is crucial that your company has enough insurance to cover your assets in the event of damaged equipment or a serious accident.</p>

<h3>Two Insurance Types</h3>

<p>When you run a small business, there are two types of insurance you can buy. There is employer insurance, which is required by law, and there is commercial business insurance, which is not necessarily required. It is wise to have both kinds of insurance to make sure that your trucking company has enough coverage.</p>

<p>There are different kinds of commercial business insurance that protect your company when something goes wrong.  General liability insurance guards against legal entanglements associated with accidents, injuries and claims of negligence. Professional liability insurance protects your company against claims of malpractice or negligence when providing a service for a customer. Finally, commercial property insurance covers the loss of and damage to your assets due to a range of events.</p>

<p>If your trucking company has employees, state law requires you to carry employers insurance that covers workers compensation and unemployment. Several states also mandate that businesses must also purchase disability insurance for employees.</p>

<p>Different states have different requirements tied to both commercial business and employer insurance. It is a good idea to discuss your trucking company’s unique insurance needs with a qualified insurance agent or broker. </p>

<h2>Six Ways to Manage Your Insurance Costs</h2>

<p>Insurance can be among the greatest expenses when owning and operating a trucking business. Fortunately, there are ways you can manage insurance costs. Here are five methods that may reduce how much you spend on insurance while still providing the coverage your company needs:</p>

<h3>Consider Your Deductible</h3>

<p>Raising your insurance policy’s deductible can lower your trucking company's monthly premium. However, you need to consider the potential risk if multiple claims are filed on the policy at one time. This could result in a significant out-of-pocket hit to your bottom line.</p>

<h3>Monitor Your Credit</h3>

<p>Your credit score affects the rates you receive from your insurance company. The better your credit score, the better the rate you will receive. There are several free credit agencies available online. Check your company's credit score often and attempt to correct any errors that may negatively affect your overall score. Circle back with your insurance agent to make sure your company’s score is accurately reflected on the policy.</p>

<h3>Stay Safe</h3>

<p>The longer your trucking company can go without a claim, the better. The safer your company’s overall record is, the lower your policy’s rate may be.</p>

<h3>Shop Around</h3>

<p>When you have time, explore the market for a better insurance rate or payment. You may find that another insurance provider is willing to give your company a better deal. Before you switch, however, be sure to check with your current insurance company to see if a discount is available for staying and coverage terms remain the same. Rely on a qualified insurance agent or broker to assist you in making these decisions.</p>

<h3>Provide Accurate Information</h3>

<p>Rates are influenced by the type of work your company performs. Be sure to consistently log miles driven, miles hauled and the types of freight shipped to receive the most accurate and up-to-date insurance rates possible. Sometimes, operating special equipment can garner a special discounted rate.</p>

<h3>Explore Premium Financing</h3>

<p>Premium financing involves the lending of funds to help your company cover the costs of insurance premiums. The financing is offered by a third party and, in some case, insurance providers and brokerages work together to offer financing solutions. Once you have taken steps to lower your insurance expenses, you might consider premium financing as a way to help your company’s cash flow. Standard premium financing usually requires a 25% down payment and between 8-10 installments over the course of a year.</p>

Just key in some information, drop your logo into the template and you are in business. Some accounting software may not walk you through everything you need to include in your invoices, however. Having thorough, accurate information ensures that the invoice can be tracked and there is a better chance of the customer paying on time. Here are eight critical things to add to your invoices before sending them out:</p>

<h3>Company Letterhead or Logo</h3>

<p>This gives your invoice an official look and assures the customer that the invoice is from your company. Make sure the word “invoice” or “bill” is displayed prominently near the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<p>Include the full name, address, phone number and other contact information for your company and the client’s company. Include the name and phone number of a contact person at the client’s company—make sure this is the person who will actually be processing the payment to avoid confusion or delays.</p>

<h3>Invoice Reference Number</h3>

<p>The reference number helps you track the invoice for accounting purposes. When a customer makes payment, ask that they reference the invoice number so you can reconcile accounts more easily.</p>

<h3>Invoice Date and Due Date</h3>

<p>These dates show the customer how long they have to make the payment.</p>

<h3>Description of the Work</h3>

<p>Make sure to include a full description of the goods or services provided so that it is easy to understand for anyone who receives the invoice. Avoid using abbreviations or industry shorthand.</p>

<h3>Cost Details</h3>

<p>Add a column that shows the number of hours worked, units purchased, and the cost of each of those items. Provide separate entries for the amount of sales tax as well as any discount you might have agreed to provide the customer.</p>

<h3>Invoice Total</h3>

<p>Make sure the total charge is displayed prominently near the bottom of the invoice.</p>

<h3>Payment Methods</h3>

<p>Outline the different ways you will accept payment, as well as the payment terms and your company’s bank account details.</p>

425,0,Blog Posts,How to do Customer Collections the Right Way,How to do Customer Collections the Right Way,"<p>Developing a timely approach to billing and collecting payments from customers is critical to maintaining your company's financial strength. Here are some helpful tips that can shorten your collection cycle and improve your company’s cash flow:</p>

<h3>Know Your Customers</h3>

<p>Working with people you trust is the most important aspect of collections. When taking on a new customer, you should check that company’s credit rating and payment history. You should also ask for credit references.</p>

<h3>Invest in Technology</h3>

<p>If poorly organized, collecting from customers can be a time-consuming process. Shop around for computer software that can help you streamline aspects like recurring billing, electronic invoicing and communication with customers. There are many affordable options for accounting software. Ultimately, the right technology can drive revenue to your business. For more information on the kind of software that might be right for your company, read our article, <a href=""http://www.rtsfinancial.com/articles/how-run-business-your-mobile-device#"">""How to Run a Business from Your Mobile Device.""</a></p>

<h3>Establish and Communicate Payment Terms</h3>

<p>You need to set up credit policies that will motivate customers to pay promptly and consistently. Those terms should be provided to the customer and agreed upon before services are rendered. Payment terms that are too strict can lower sales, while more lenient policies might slow customer payments. A good rule is to require payment within 30 days. If it fits into your business plan, you can motivate customers to pay you more quickly by offering a small discount (for example, a 2% discount for payment within 10 days). Another alternative is factoring. Many factoring companies will charge less than 2% and buy your invoices daily.</p>

<h3>Bill Promptly</h3>

<p>The receivables clock starts ticking when you deliver a product or service. For your customer, it starts only after they get an invoice. Waiting a few days to send out invoices slows the process even more. The solution is simple: the sooner you mail invoices, the faster you will get paid.</p>

<h3>Create a Process and Stick To It</h3>

<p>The ability to consistently follow up with customers about unpaid invoices is critical to your company’s stability. The most effective approach may vary depending on the industry, but most companies follow up with a phone call or email to their customers after 30 days. Other steps in the process can include re-invoicing, late payment penalties and enlisting a collection agency. Establish a collections process that is most effective for your business and remain diligent in executing it.</p>

<h3>Don’t Let Receivables Build Up</h3>

<p>Accounts receivable may have a dollar value, but they cannot help your company until the customer pays. To ensure you have enough cash to fuel your operations, do not carry too many unpaid receivables on your books. You may also consider factoring as a way to quickly turn those accounts receivable into working cash.</p>

<h2><strong>How To Make Customer Collection Calls</strong></h2>

<p>No one enjoys making a phone call seeking an overdue payment from a customer. Still, collection calls are a necessary part of doing business. Doing them the right way can solidify your cash flow and help your company meet its own expenses. Developing a technique for handling these calls will help you collect quickly on past-due payments. You should also try to anticipate how a customer will react to your call. Some customers may be apologetic while others can be defensive or angry. Some customers may even try to win your sympathy. Below are some common excuses you can expect from customers on why they have not paid on time, along with suggestions on how to respond. At all times your tone should be courteous and professional. You are not trying to win an argument. You are just trying to get paid.</p>

<h3>Customer Excuse #1:</h3>

<p><em>“I didn’t receive your invoice.”</em></p>

<h3>Your Response:</h3>

<p><em>“I’m sorry about that. Let me go over your contact information to make sure it is correct and we can send the invoice out again.”</em> This may be a legitimate reason for nonpayment. Your response shows you are giving the customer the benefit of the doubt. It also tells the customer that you are diligent with your collections and they can expect to receive an invoice soon.</p>

<h3>Customer Excuse #2:</h3>

<p><em>“We already cut you a check for that.”</em></p>

<h3>Your Response:</h3>

<p><em>“Good! What day did you mail it? What is the check number and when can we expect to receive it?”</em> This customer excuse can be misleading. Some debtors may cut a check for an invoice, then hold on to that check until they have more cash on hand. Your response requires the customer to confirm whether the check was mailed or not. If it has not been mailed, your next step is to get the customer to commit to a date when they will send you the payment. Let the customer know that you are documenting that commitment and will follow up if it is not met.</p>

<h3>Customer Excuse #3:</h3>

<p><em>“Sorry, but we just don’t have the money to pay you.”</em></p>

<h3>Your Response:</h3>

<p><em>“I’m really sorry to hear that. We want to work with you on this. Is there a time when you will be able to pay us?”</em> If a customer confesses to you that they simply cannot pay, express empathy but focus on a pathway to payment. Emphasize that your company wants to find a workable solution for both parties. That might mean breaking the invoice down into smaller payments. A customer may not be able to pay $5,000 at once, but perhaps they can pay $500 a month over 10 months. In some cases you may need to accept less payment than was originally charged. Avoid getting into a dispute and broker a deal that will salvage at least some money for your company.</p>

<h3>Customer Excuse #4:</h3>

<p><em>“We have an issue with the amount you charged.”</em></p>

<h3>Your Response:</h3>

<p><em>“Let’s talk about that. I have all the documentation right here in front of me. Do you have a minute to walk through everything that happened on the job?”</em> Be courteous but firm. Let the customer know you have all the information at hand and are knowledgeable about the work performed. If the customer has a legitimate complaint, try to address the concerns. You may even agree to knock some charges off the account. However, let the customer know that a new invoice will be mailed out right away. Encourage your customers to call you at any time with an issue rather than waiting for your company to call them.</p>

<h3>Customer Excuse #5:</h3>

<p><em>“You didn’t get our payment? I don’t know what happened. I’m going to have to look into this and get back to you.”</em></p>

<h3>Your Response:</h3>

<p><em>“Okay, when do you think you can get back to me? If it’s easier, I can be sure to call you again tomorrow. Let me know when would be a good time for us to talk.”</em> “Let me get back to you,” is a common dodge that late-paying debtors employ. How you respond to this excuse is critical. Do not settle for a promise to call you back. Make sure that the customer understands that if you do not receive an answer, you will call again tomorrow. In fact, you will be calling the customer every day until the payment issue is resolved.</p>

426,0,Blog Posts,What is a Cash Flow Budget (and Why Do You Need One)?,What is a Cash Flow Budget (and Why Do You Need One)?,"<p>Your company may turn a profit today, but will it be profitable six months from today? It is crucial to carefully track how much money your company is taking in and how much it needs for the future. Maintaining a cash flow budget will help you forecast your company’s overall financial health.</p>

<p>Many companies are profitable on paper, yet still get into trouble because they do not have the cash on hand to fund their operations. The owners of these companies may be familiar with their income statement, but they do not know their cash balance.</p>

<p>Your cash flow budget (sometimes called a “cash flow forecast”) does not need to be complex. You can keep the information in an Excel spreadsheet. Some accounting software products like QuickBooks and Xero can also help you create a cash flow budget.</p>

<p>Your calculations in the cash flow budget do not need to be completely accurate. You are making your best educated guess as to your company’s cash position for the coming months. A reliable cash flow budget requires regular revision at least once per month.</p>

<h2>How a Cash Flow Budget Can Work</h2>

<p>What follows is a fictional example to illustrate a typical cash flow budget. Mike’s company, Long Haul Truckers Inc., did $100,000 worth of business in December. However, customers usually wait 30 to 45 days to pay the company’s invoices. When updating his cash flow budget, Mike budgets that $100,000 as part of his cash inflow two months out. The work may have been done in December, but the cash will not come in until early February. Mike will not be able to use that money to operate Long Haul Truckers until then.</p>

<p>The cash flow budget is an effective way to keep up with real-time company expenditures. Fixed costs for Mike’s company – items like mortgage and lease payments, salaries and insurance – are $30,000 per month. Variable costs – which include expenses like fuel, lodging and other operating costs – range greatly from month to month. Those costs largely depend on how many miles Long Haul Truckers puts on its fleet. Mike also knows that he must purchase a new trailer in January. His company’s first payment on the trailer comes the following month, so he budgets that expense for February.</p>

<p>Taking into account the influx of $100,000 in February and the new trailer expense that same month, here is how Mike’s cash flow budget looks:  </p>

</table>

<p>Thanks to the $100,000 that Mike expects to receive by February, Long Haul Truckers should have about $75,000 in the bank at the end of that month. The net cash flow for February, which subtracts expenditures from the receivables for that month, is projected to be $60,000. Mike estimates the cumulative cash flow at the end of February will be $75,000. Cumulative cash flow combines the cash flow at the beginning of the month with the net cash flow produced by the end of the month.</p>

<p>Most of the fields for the month of March are not filled out yet. It is too far in the future for Mike to accurately forecast receivables and variable costs. This illustrates why it is important to regularly update the cash flow budget, as inflows and expenditures may change.</p>

<p>As tires age and tread wears, rolling resistance actually decreases and fuel efficiency improves.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Can the right set of tires really help you save a significant amount of money on fuel?</p>

<p>The answer is yes. The amount of energy your tires exert while rolling under a full load can greatly affect the fuel consumption of your truck.</p>

<h2>How Tires Save Fuel</h2>

<p>Tires are not the biggest factor when it comes to paying less at the pump, but they represent an easy way to make your truck more fuel-friendly. How do tires make a difference? It is a matter of simple physics. Rolling resistance—the pressure that a rolling tire puts on the road—is one force that works against your truck’s speed. Other factors include air resistance, friction loss in the engine and steep inclines. Some experts report that as much as a third of a truck’s fuel consumption is caused by tire rolling resistance. When factoring in cars and other vehicles, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 5% to 15% of U.S. fuel consumption is related to rolling resistance.</p>

<p>Any improvement made to the rolling resistance of a truck does not directly correlate with the amount saved on fuel, but it does help. A 5% improvement in rolling resistance might translate into around 2% less fuel consumed. As trucks have become more aerodynamic in design, rolling resistance has had a smaller impact on fuel use, but it is still significant. For a company that spends $500,000 annually on fuel, that 2% reduction means saving $10,000 a year.</p>

<h2>Getting the Most from Your Tires</h2>

<p>So how do you lower rolling resistance and lower your fuel costs? Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Traction matters.</strong> Back in the days before rising oil prices, heavier traction was an attractive quality. Tires with deep treads and lug patterns were popular then. The fuel-efficient tires of today offer less traction and rolling resistance but do not limit a truck’s safe operation. Studies show that even a switch from duel tires to wide-base singles does not compromise safe driving in hazardous conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Older tires can be more efficient than new ones.</strong> That is because their treads are not as deep. As a tread wears down, the fuel efficiency of the tire usually increases due to less traction. The second half of your tires’ tread life can save you more money than the first half.</li>
	<li><strong>Uneven tire pressure can add expense.</strong> Proper inflation for a given tire size and truckload will reduce the flexing, stress and build-up in the tire that lead to wasteful fuel use. The casing of the tire is important as well. Even retreaded casings that retain fuel efficiency can be effective.</li>
	<li><strong>Not all axles are the same.</strong> The amount of rolling resistance per axle is equal to the amount of weight that axle bears. Therefore, the trailer axles on a tractor-trailer offer the best chance of fuel savings.</li>
	<li><strong>It pays to do research.</strong> Every tire company offers a fuel-efficient product for trucks. Take the time to surf the Web for customer reviews, independent studies and price comparisons to make sure you find the right set of tires for your fuel-saving needs.</li>

</div>

<p>The right set of tires can cut down on rolling resistance and increase fuel savings. To maximize fuel efficiency for your fleet, you might also consider using aluminum wheels.</p>

<p>Truck wheels forged from aluminum cost more money than steel wheels. A 22.5” by 8.25” steel wheel sells for between $100 and $140. An aluminum wheel in the same size can cost anywhere from $260 to $340. However, aluminum wheels are the smarter investment over the long run, both for the environment and a trucking company’s balance sheet.</p>

<p>Here are some of the key benefits of aluminum truck wheels:</p>

<h2>Fuel Efficiency</h2>

<p>Research shows that, when combined with low rolling resistance tires, aluminum wheels can reduce the fuel consumption of a tractor-trailer by 3% or more. Aluminum wheels substantially decrease the carbon footprint of commercial vehicles. A 2012 study of Alcoa Inc.’s forged aluminum wheels found trucks that switched from steel to aluminum reduced carbon emissions by 16.3 metric tons over the lifespan of the wheels. That reduction equals the carbon footprint of a U.S. household over a year’s time.</p>

<h2>Weight</h2>

<p>Aluminum wheels are much lighter than their steel counterparts. In 2014, Alcoa rolled out its Ultra One aluminum truck wheel, which weighs 47% less than a steel wheel of the same size. Another wheel manufacturer, Accuride International, reports that each of its aluminum wheels weigh 30 pounds less than a steel wheel.</p>

<p>Alcoa estimates its new aluminum wheels can lighten a rig by as much as 1,400 pounds. This weight reduction improves fuel efficiency and allows trucks to haul larger loads. That decreases the number of necessary hauls over time, further reducing the amount of fuel consumption.</p>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>Although they cost less to purchase, steel wheels are high-maintenance. Steel requires a lot of refurbishing such as removing rust, re-painting, and touch-up work. This leads to higher lifetime costs. In contrast, aluminum wheels can be cleaned with soap and water. If the manufacturer has given the aluminum wheel the proper surface treatments, the wheel should have a shiny appearance with minimal maintenance.</p>

<h2>Durability</h2>

<p>Because aluminum wheels are made from a one-piece process, they are usually better balanced, which makes for improved ride quality and less wear on tires. Newer aluminum wheel models are also stronger. Alcoa’s new aluminum alloy, MagnaForce, is 17% stronger than the industry standard. That strength leads to a longer working life.</p>

<h2>Resale and End-of-Life</h2>

<p>The durability and long life of aluminum wheels add value to your trucks, even when it is time to sell them. Research shows that trucks equipped with aluminum wheels have a higher trade-in value. Wheel manufacturers report that the resale value of aluminum wheels is typically more than 50% of the original investment as much as 10 years earlier.</p>

<p>Even at the end of their life, aluminum wheels have value because they are recyclable. They will never be taken to a landfill.</p>

508,0,Blog Posts,What Are Spot Market Rates?,What Are Spot Market Rates?,"<p>Chances are you’ve heard of spot market rates. The term has been tossed around a lot in recent years, mostly due to the increasing popularity of spot rate trucking work. Owner-operators and independent fleet owners who might have previously been avoiding the spot market in the effort to establish contract work have become more interested.</p>

<h2>What Are Spot Market Rates?</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, spot market rates in trucking are simply shipping prices that exist right now, today. They represent how much it costs to ship goods, freight and cargo if you were to get hired – on the spot. Spot market rates are usually paid by brokers, versus standard shippers you might otherwise contract with.</p>

<p>Spot market rates differ from contract rates in that they are not fixed, so they fluctuate from day to day, much more quickly than contract rates. The fluctuation in rates depends on a variety of economic and logistical factors, most particularly load-to-truck ratio.</p>

<p>If there are fewer trucks on the road during a given week, but a surplus of freight, spot rates go up. If there’s more capacity, rates go down. For much of 2017-2018, spot market rates ticked steadily upward, as truck shortages persisted in the face of high demand.</p>

<p>Spot rates are often measured daily or weekly by third parties but have been known to change hourly as well. They affect and are included in dry van, reefer and flatbed shipping.</p>

<h2>How Does This Impact You?</h2>

<p>Many trucker drivers and fleet owners prefer relationships with shippers and brokers where they can work out contracts quickly and then get on the road, month after month. Some work with spot market rates to fulfill capacity in between contracts, but many have never fully explored the topic.</p>

<p>As you probably know, 2018 was a banner year in trucking in the United States. A combination of economic growth, a continuing shortage of trucks, the ongoing growth of e-commerce and historic highs in agricultural exports led to the highest number of for-hire truck shipments ever, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation and Statistics. In the midst of all this growth, spot market rates reached highs of +22% over contract rates in 2018. That translates into a lot of earning potential.</p>

<h2>Spot Market Rates Compared to Contracts</h2>

<p>When you work with spot market rates, you deal with the volatility of shorter-term rates. This is compared to the longer-term commitment of a contract that won’t change as quickly or as severely as a spot market rate can. Contracts tend to be the slower-moving but steadier option.</p>

<p>The spot market in trucking isn’t as directly tied to the economy as the stock market, but it does fluctuate in a similar way that is usually still in line with certain overall economic trends. Spot market rates leave a lot of the future predictions out of shipping, bringing trucking back around to the more direct equation of immediate supply and demand.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you decide from day to day, it’s a good idea to consider how spot market rates can positively affect your bottom-line and future earnings, especially when compared to contract rates.</p>

522,0,Blog Posts,Freight Forwarder vs. Freight Broker,Freight Forwarder vs. Freight Broker,"<p align=""left"">The logistics industry is very complex, and there are a lot of moving parts to ensure that freight gets to its destination hitch-free and in perfect condition. While moving big shipments across the world, the journey often takes weeks, passes through many hands and involves a number of intermediaries. With such an elaborate process, it is important to understand the roles of everyone involved and what their impact is.</p>

<p align=""left"">Here are the significant differences between freight brokers and freight forwarders:</p>

<h2 align=""left""><b>Who is a Freight Broker?</b></h2>

<p align=""left"">The freight broker’s job is quite simple; they connect the people who have freight to move (shippers) with the people who will move it (carriers). Many carriers prefer to work with freight brokers because, in addition to helping them source for customers, the brokers offer them more volume than they would usually get if they worked with individual customers. Conversely, the individual customers often prefer to work with freight brokers because brokers have more bargaining power when negotiating rates with carriers.</p>

<p align=""left"">Freight brokers typically save carriers the time and resources it would take to find large volume clients. And they save the customer money by getting them better deals. In return for their service, brokers take a percentage of the total cost of the transaction as commission.</p>

<h2 align=""left""><b>Who is a Freight Forwarder? </b></h2>

<p align=""left"">Freight forwarders, on the other hand, are more active in the shipping process. The forwarder collects a shipment from the customer (shipper) and takes responsibility for its transportation from one location to the other, whether it’s by land, air or water. They handle freight storage, assemble/distribute the shipment as required, make arrangements for the forwarding of the cargo in accordance to the customer’s wishes, negotiate with the shipping company and oversee the delivery of freight to its destination.</p>

<p align=""left"">Furthermore, the forwarder prepares all the documents (e.g., bill of lading, certificate of origin, F178) needed to transport and clear the shipment at the exit/entry point. Since the freight forwarders are liable for any losses or damages, they also provide insurance coverage for shipments under their charge.</p>

<h2 align=""left""><b>The Major Differences</b></h2>

<ul>
	<li align=""left"">The freight broker never receives the cargo and is never responsible for it. The forwarder takes possession of the cargo and is legally responsible for its safety until final delivery. </li>
	<li align=""left"">While a freight forwarder needs warehouses, one or two trucks and agents that will oversee the transportation of the cargo, a freight brokerage may or may not own trucks or warehouses (asset or non-asset based) and can be run remotely, regardless of where the shippers and carriers are located. </li>
</ul>

<h2 align=""left""><b>What Does This Mean to Carriers?</b></h2>

<p align=""left"">Trucking companies are a big part of the logistics industry, and since they often work with freight brokers and freight forwarders, it’s important to know what to expect:</p>

<ul>
	<li align=""left"">Forwarders and brokers are not legally required to pay carriers until the customer has paid them. Because brokers are often less involved in the actual movement of freight, you may only speak to them over the phone – make sure they are a registered company and have legitimate business practices before working with them.</li>
	<li align=""left"">While hauling freight for a forwarder, make sure that you carefully check for any damages or shortages before accepting the shipment. This may take some time, but it will potentially save you from legal issues in the future.</li>
	<li align=""left"">Read any documentation carefully before signing rate sheets from brokers or forwarders. The document is legally-binding, and by appending your signature, you agree to the terms.</li>
</ul>

<p align=""left"">As a carrier, knowing the difference between a freight forwarder and a freight broker is very important.  It helps you understand your role and responsibilities and gives you an idea of what to expect when doing business with either one.</p>

523,0,Blog Posts,Blockchain Technology In Trucking,Blockchain Technology In Trucking,"<p>In the fall of 2018, dexFreight made headlines when it completed a blockchain-based shipment using smart contracts. The company teamed up with a seafood wholesaler, carrier and smart contracts platform provider to ship 5,320 pounds of frozen food from Medley, Florida to Sunrise, Florida.</p>

<p>Moving frozen foods from Point A to Point B certainly isn’t newsworthy, but the process behind the transaction was. Funds for the transaction were held in escrow by the smart contract integrated platform and were automatically released to the carrier upon delivery.</p>

<p>All of this became possible through dexFreight’s blockchain-based verified identity and objective reputation system created from smart contract data and key performance indicators (KPIs), such as on-time pickup and delivery, on-time payments, loading and unloading times, freight claims, etc.</p>

<p>Upon the transaction’s completion, Rjat Rajbhandari, CEO and co-founder of dexFreight, reported in a press release, “This is a huge milestone toward an imminent transformation of the logistics industry through the adoption of blockchain technology.”</p>

<p>News headlines proclaim blockchain will revolutionize, transform, disrupt and change trucking and logistics as its momentum builds. Early adopters, such as Walmart Inc., which began requiring its leafy green suppliers to track their produce from farm to store on its blockchain platform, are propelling its use forward. In fact, experts predict that blockchain use in trucking and logistics will become commonplace within three to seven years.</p>

<p>Among the uses for blockchain in trucking are smart contracts, carrier performance history, vehicle maintenance, compliance, payments and pricing, cold chain validation, damage verification and detailed driver information.</p>

<h2><strong>But what exactly is blockchain?</strong></h2>

<p>Imagine a chain necklace and how each link in the chain attaches to the one before and after it. A blockchain is a little like that. All information added to the blockchain is housed in what is known as a block and all these blocks link together to form a chain.</p>

<p>All the blocks put together can tell you a story about the data in the database (when it was updated and by whom) because each block holds a data record containing a unique identifying number (or hash) as well as information from the block before it.</p>

<p>In addition, blockchain is a database that does not have a central point; data in this database is housed on many different computers in many different locations. When someone changes a record in this decentralized database, all the computers in the blockchain receive the updated information. This is possible because every participant in a blockchain system occupies what is known as a node, which gives them access to the entire database record or data story.</p>

<p>These combined features form an independent, transparent and permanent database, coexisting on multiple servers in multiple locations, and shared by a community. This database can be trusted for three primary reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Data added to a blockchain undergoes a vetting process to reach critical consensus,</li>
	<li>Data added to a blockchain can be trusted because it goes in with digital signatures, and</li>
	<li>There are multiple copies of the information meaning it cannot be changed without others in the database knowing of the change. If a user independently changes a copy, it becomes inconsistent with the rest of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, what goes into a blockchain remains unchanged and unaltered, which is why it can be used to store information relevant to business transactions and why it offers a host of uses in the trucking industry. Every transaction that takes place on the blockchain is visible to everyone else on the network, and nothing can be removed. This transparency removes the points where fraud occurs and eliminates double brokering.</p>

<p>Sometimes blockchain is confused with cryptocurrency. But the two are not one in the same. Blockchain started as the underlying technology layer to allow the exchange of cryptocurrencies (digital or virtual currency) between parties. Essentially, in its original form, blockchain allowed Party A and Party B to transact with each other without an intermediary and share information across an entire network.</p>

<p>Blockchain has since evolved. It’s not just a public network that allows sharing of information in a decentralized manner. Now there is a group-based blockchain (called consortium-based), which allows restrictive access that is not open to the public; it’s private. Permissions can be used to allow third parties and intermediaries to be part of the process and provide value within the transaction’s journey.</p>

<p>Of the three existing types of blockchain – public, private and consortium – most believe that trucking and logistics will rely on consortium, which allows access only to specific members of the consortium or group. In contrast, a public blockchain is open to anyone, while a private blockchain requires permission to access.</p>

<p>However, trucking and logistics may end up using all types, depending on the circumstances of the situation. For example, payment transactions might be a consortium or private, while sharing geo-locations of shipments might be public. Privacy is also a determining factor of what is shared.  </p>

<h2><strong>How can blockchain be used?</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most basic implementations of blockchain can be found in streamlining the payment system.</p>

<p>Currently, much of the industry relies on a paper-based model to process payments. On average it takes 45 days to get a payment executed and settled. By digitizing routes and putting smart contracts into the blockchain, a transfer of funds can occur as soon as a delivery is completed. Basically, the contract executes itself, as the dexFreight example showed. This digitized process eliminates the need to file paperwork requesting payment, sends money electronically and drives efficiency by decreasing the number of days it takes to execute, settle and pay on transportation-related transactions.</p>

<p>This capability can reduce or even eliminate disputes. Blockchain would automate proof of delivery, expediting payments and settlements. Today, if a company decides not to pay a transportation bill, a trucking company may have to submit and resubmit paperwork many times before the issue is resolved. But with smart contracts and blockchain, the company is paid immediately.</p>

<p>Another area where blockchain would be useful is maintenance. Trucking companies could employ blockchain to maintain indisputable maintenance records on their vehicles. The blockchain would maintain an item-by-item record of vehicle repairs for every truck in a fleet. Companies could buy, sell and repair vehicles with verifiably accurate records in hand. </p>

<p>Blockchain could also be paired with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to share geo-location information, which enables businesses and/or consumers to know at a glance where their goods are. Customers can see their goods in transport, estimate their delivery and know in real-time when there is a delay. This use in food logistics would enable distributors to quickly trace contaminated food back to its source, reducing the tracking process to minutes instead of days. IoT sensors placed inside the truck can monitor temperature, and if the temperature rises above what is considered safe, the driver could be notified automatically and the truck rerouted to a closer location before the food spoils.</p>

<p>Digitization will be able to give companies and consumers peace of mind, allowing them to know where their products are, when they are going to arrive and the environmental conditions that were faced along the way.</p>

<p>In addition, blockchain introduces transparency, which can help all involved see when and where capacity opens. With this information, trucking load-matching apps can identify excess capacity across a distribution network and coordinate load distribution and transportation.</p>

<h2><strong>What are the barriers to implementation?</strong></h2>

<p>As with every new technology, blockchain must overcome a few hurdles before its use is widespread.</p>

<p>First, the industry needs to leave its analog days behind.</p>

<p>“The industry has to have more digitization of the paper-based environment surrounding invoicing in order to start using blockchain, and to harness its actual value,” said Arlen Stark, chief of staff for the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). “Several technologies are readily available to convert that paper invoice to a digital invoice, whether it’s through the use of EDI, API or by driver’s taking a photograph and sending it out electronically. There are several ways to do it, but to harness the potential value of blockchain, the analog environment has to be digitized in some way.”</p>

<p>Once that happens, Stark explains it will be possible to look at what needs to be done to have an executable and potentially enforceable smart contract tied to a blockchain transaction. Then, instead of going back and forth over email, phone, or digital contract execution platforms like DocuSign to execute a contract, a smart contract is in place and once certain conditions are met, the contract will execute, and payment will be triggered.</p>

<p>Additionally, privacy concerns will need to be sorted out as all participants hold and can view the data in the blockchain, except for data that is marked as private. Stark said, “The early adopters are going to find ways to use the technology irrespective of privacy. They’re believers in it no matter what. But for others to feel comfortable and to gain mass adoption of the technology, things like privacy and processing time acceleration will need to be taken into consideration and accounted for.”</p>

<p>Collaboration is key as it will require all involved to adhere to the same protocols and standards to harness the potential value.</p>

<p>Finally, because blockchain code is open source, it can complicate the protection of intellectual property rights. That is becoming less and less of an issue, added Stark, who stated that companies are now more openly discussing what they are doing and how they’re doing it as it pertains to blockchain and other technologies that tie into blockchain.</p>

<p> “Every company is at a different stage in its blockchain journey. Some are very heavy on the tech side of things and well-versed in the technical aspects of blockchain, and then you have companies that are in the very early stages of adoption,” he said. “We have to cater to these different stages of knowledge as it pertains to this really awesome technology.”</p>

<p>But when it all shakes out, Stark concluded, “Digitization, and the application of emerging technologies like blockchain, hold huge potential to accelerate the adoption of value-adding business processes. This is particularly true for trucking, one of the largest and most important industries in our economy.""</p>

551,0,Blog Posts,The Difference between Cost-Plus and Retail-Minus Fuel Savings,The Difference between Cost-Plus and Retail-Minus Fuel Savings,"<p>In trucking, there are two key ways to save money on diesel fuel: “cost-plus” and “retail-minus.” Which approach will save your company more money? The answer depends on market conditions and what parts of the country your fleet serves.</p>

<p>With the retail-minus pricing structure, drivers pay the posted pump price at a fuel stop. That retail price includes the cost of the fuel, taxes and a retail margin covering all expenses of doing business. The “minus” is the negotiated rebate that your fuel card provider pays you later on gallons you purchase.</p>

<p>With the cost-plus model, you do not pay the retail price. Your driver pays a rack price based on the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) nationwide index, plus state and federal taxes. Added to this is a fixed fee set independently of the station’s pump price.</p>

<h2>Which One is Better?</h2>

<p>Which approach saves more money depends on retail margins and where your fleet fuels up. In places like California or Hawaii where the cost of transporting fuel to retailers is more expensive, cost-plus usually saves more money. In areas like the Gulf Coast where fuel is cheaper and the margins thinner, retail-minus is usually the better option.</p>

<p>One benefit of retail-minus over cost-plus is that its pricing is more transparent. There is little explanation as to how cost-plus OPIS index prices are set or why they are changed. With retail-minus, the pump price remains the pump price. Fleet managers that operate nationwide usually generate more savings with the retail-minus model.</p>

715,0,Blog Posts,The Difference Between Tiered and Flat Factoring Rates,The Difference Between Tiered and Flat Factoring Rates,"<h2><strong>What is factoring? </strong></h2>

<p>Factoring is when a factoring company purchases your open invoices. In simplified terms, you send a factoring company your invoices and they pay you the invoice total minus a factoring fee. You get the money within 24 hours instead of waiting 30 – 60 days for your customer to pay, immediately increasing your cash flow.</p>

<p>But how much does factoring cost? Factoring companies make money from a factoring rate or fee on each factored invoice. There are two main types of factoring rates: Flat rates and tiered rates. Each has its own benefits and either might be best for your business based on your needs.</p>

<h2><strong>Flat Factoring Rates are Consistent </strong></h2>

<p>A flat factoring rate means the percentage you pay on each factored invoice is always the same. You know exactly what you’re paying in exchange for the advance on your invoice, regardless of how quickly or slowly your customers pay the factoring company for your invoice.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You submit a $1,000 invoice to your factoring company.</li>
	<li>They pay you an advance on the invoice, minus the factoring fee.
	<ul>
		<li>If the advance rate is 97%, you will receive $970. If the flat fee is 3%, they keep the remaining balance and the transaction is complete (as long as your customer pays the invoice).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This fee remains the same (consistently 3%), no matter how long it takes for the factoring company to receive the invoice payment from your customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few key reasons why a business might prefer flat-rate factoring. You always know your costs, and because your flat rate is dependable, you can plan for them with certainty. In some cases, for example if you substantially increase the amount you factor per month, your flat fee might become lower. It will remain consistent for every invoice though. </p>

<h2><strong>Tiered Factoring Rates Provide Opportunities for Savings</strong></h2>

<p>A tiered factoring rate means the percentage you pay on each factored invoice is a variable amount that depends on how quickly your customers pay the invoice.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You submit a $1,000 invoice to your factoring company</li>
	<li>They pay you an advance on the invoice.
	<ul>
		<li>If the advance rate is 97%, you will receive $970. The remaining 3% is kept as a reserve until your customer pays the balance on the invoice.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When your customer pays the factoring company, the factoring company will send you the remaining balance (reserve), minus a factoring fee. The fee amount will depend on the number of days it took your customer to pay the factoring company on the invoice. If your customer pays the factoring company quickly, your variable rate is lower, and you get more of the reserve back.  
	<ul>
		<li>If your customer pays within 10 days, the fee is only 1% (you get 2% back)</li>
		<li>If your customer pays within 20 days, the fee is 2% (you get 1% back)</li>
		<li>If you customer takes over 30 days to pay, the fee is 3% (you don’t get any additional money back)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In exchange for predictability, tiered rates often result in savings. You will end up paying a lower factoring fee when your customers pay on time or earlier than anticipated.</p>

<h2><strong>How Do These Different Options Affect My Business?</strong></h2>

<p>The type of rate structure you need for factoring will depend on your specific business needs and the types of invoices (and customers) you are factoring. </p>

<p>Things to consider might include: </p>

<ul>
	<li>How your operations are structured – Does it help to plan for a flat rate, or is it worth waiting to finalize your books in pursuit of potential savings?</li>
	<li>How dependably your customers pay on time (and in what volume) – Do most of your customers pay within 30 days? Do you have large invoices where the difference in fees could result in substantial savings?</li>
</ul>

740,0,Blog Posts,Paying for Diesel Fuel with Cash Versus Credit,Paying for Diesel Fuel with Cash Versus Credit,"<p>Cash versus credit pricing is exactly like it sounds – a merchant selling fuel may charge a customer different prices based on how they choose to pay for their fuel, whether using cash or credit card. The cash price is less expensive than the credit price. This is because when a fuel station charges more for credit fuel purchases (or less for cash), they are trying to offset the processing fees they are being charged by credit card companies every time their customers swipe a card.</p>

<h2>What Do the Prices Actually Mean?</h2>

<p>You might see the price difference between cash and credit in a few different ways, depending on the state:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some states advertise a price and charge more if the customer pays with credit – a credit surcharge.</li>
	<li>Some states advertise a price and charge less if the customer pays with cash – a cash discount.</li>
	<li>Some states advertise two prices – one credit price and one cash price.</li>
</ul>

<p>Surcharges for credit purchases have been outlawed in some states. In these cases, a merchant selling fuel will usually raise the overall price of fuel per gallon to reflect the amount of the ‘normal’ price plus the credit card fee. Then they will offer a discount on that price per gallon for customers who pay cash. The credit surcharge becomes perfectly legal when it is positioned as the standard price with discounts for cash.</p>

<p>In states where you see two listed prices, it was likely mandated by law. Fuel stations in these states are required to show two prices, for example $1 per gallon for cash and $1.06 per gallon for credit. When looking for a fuel station in a state with two listed prices, is important to consider which price is more obviously advertised. Most often, the prices advertised prominently (think large highway billboards) reflect the cash price, which is lower.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is the future of debit card purchases. Currently, using a debit card to pay for fuel at some stations might mean that you pay the higher credit price. However, recent legislation may result in a third type of pricing for debit cards, which will fall somewhere between cash and credit price.</p>

<h2>What Can I Do About It?</h2>

<p>Whether you’re operating a large fleet or a single truck, fuel is one of your largest operating costs. When considering any added cost per gallon, even if it’s just a few cents, it’s worth looking into your fuel purchasing options.</p>

<p>Carrying around large amounts of cash to pay for fuel may not be reasonable or worth the risk. And some credit cards may offer cash back on certain purchases, like fuel, but make sure you do the basic math on how much you’d actually save. You could end up paying more than even the credit price when you factor in interest rates, fees (for things like late payments), and whether any cashback offers on fuel are promotional and available for only a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>Another option is signing up for a fuel card. Look for a fuel card that offers discounts off the cash price and make sure you consider any transaction or monthly fees when choosing a card. A low per-transaction fee, for example 50¢, will likely end up costing you less than paying 6¢ extra per gallon for a 150-gallon fill up. And if you have a fuel card with great discounts off the cash price (think 18¢ off the cash price), you could end up saving far more than you would have with just the cash price discount.</p>

741,0,Blog Posts,What to Watch Out for With Merchant Cash Advances,What to Watch Out for With Merchant Cash Advances,"<p>When operating a business, there may be certain times when fluctuations in cash flow become particularly challenging. You might find yourself considering a Merchant Cash Advance (MCA), among other financing options, to help. Before you apply for an MCA, though, it’s wise to make sure you understand exactly how MCAs work and the impact they can have on the financial health of your business.</p>

<h2>What is an MCA?</h2>

<p>An MCA is a cash advance to your business based on projected future sales, which are typically predicted by looking at your recurring credit and debit card transactions. With an MCA, you receive a lump-sum that instantly becomes part of your cash flow. At the same time you receive the advance, you agree to allow the MCA lender to withdraw payments directly from your bank account so that you can immediately begin paying it back.</p>

<h2>Why Choose an MCA?</h2>

<p>MCA’s are mostly unregulated by the government. This means that your company is likely to receive an MCA quickly after applying and without jumping through very many hoops. Since it can serve as immediate short-term capital, some businesses find this type of financing helpful at crucial points when extra funding is needed quickly.</p>

<h2>How is an MCA Different from a Traditional Loan?</h2>

<p>An MCA is tied to your future sales transactions versus more traditional collateral, and the payback is also tied directly to your credit and debit transactions. Being primarily unregulated also means the payback structure and rates can have a wide range, on average anywhere from 14 to 50 cents on the dollar. The term of the advance may also vary more than with a traditional loan. Regardless of what is considered average, the math remains directly tied to your sales, so it’s especially important that you understand the payback structure before accepting the MCA.</p>

<h2>What are the Drawbacks?</h2>

<p>Unregulated markets cut both ways. In exchange for speed and flexibility, you trade risk. While tying borrowed money directly to future transactions may seem like a legitimate form of collateral, no one can predict the future. Also, because of that risk, the rates you pay for your MCA can become quite high (again, unregulated). And if you end up taking longer than planned to pay back the money (because future sales aren’t as predicted), you could end up paying much more than anticipated. This could eat into such a high portion of your sales that your business profit suffers, or you could go further into debt. Furthermore, many MCA lenders require direct access to your bank account, so they can take out automatic payments daily. This can be easy for the logistics of paying it off but could result in even more cash flow problems.</p>

<h2>What is a ‘Confession of Judgment’?</h2>

<p>It has become common for MCA lenders to include a Confession of Judgment as part of their agreement. Be very wary of these – a Confession of Judgment effectively grants the provider of the MCA a quick path to a judgement without having to pursue litigation. Which basically means they can avoid normal court proceedings in the case of a dispute or law suit. It’s often a good idea to consult with legal counsel before accepting an MCA that includes a COJ.</p>

<p>It’s important to know the facts before accepting an MCA, but if you already have one? Monitor your bank account closely and be sure there is always money for the withdrawal. Once you default, even unintentionally, some MCA lenders will get aggressive. Some lenders accept settlements, but you may find yourself needing help with negotiations.</p>

<h2>A Leading Cause of Highway Deaths</h2>

<p>More than 3,000 people die every year from cashes caused by distracted driving. According to an analysis of over 65 million vehicle trips, distracted driving occured in 36 percent of trips nationwide over a six-month period.</p>

<h2>Phones Are a Major Distraction</h2>

<p>The number of motorists who admit to using phones while driving continues to rise. According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, nearly half (49 percent) of drivers reported recently talking on a hand-held phone while driving and nearly 35 percent have sent a text or email. Although many people believe that hands-free phone technology is safer than using a hand-held device, the National Safety Council found that drivers who use any kind of phone technology while driving are 50% less aware of their driving environment.</p>

<h2>Truckers Are Not Immune</h2>

<p>It is true that professional truck drivers are typically considered safer drivers, with an overall crash rate that is 29% lower than other vehicles. However, according to driver safety intelligence company, SmartDrive Systems, the truck drivers that are distracted by mobile devices are at the highest risk for problems compared with drivers distracted by other practices, such as smoking or paperwork. And drivers distracted by mobile phones are three times more likely to do engage in other risky behaviors like exceeding the speed limit or ignoring a stoplight.</p>

<h2>Increased Penalties</h2>

<p>The increased use of phones will driving by truck drivers led the FMCSA to implement stricter penalties. Violations cover any cell phone use while driving, including reaching for, holding, dialing or texting on the device. Penalties increased to a maximum fine of $14,739 for the carrier company and $3,685 for drivers. And they're pushing for those regulations to apply to all drivers nationwide.</p>

This is live. don't publish this.



<p>Understanding how much money your trucking company makes (and spends) on a per-mile basis is crucial to booking profitable loads. To better calculate your fleet’s costs, revenue and profit per mile, you must determine the fuel efficiency of each truck you operate. Specifically, you need to know how much money you spend on diesel for every mile your trucks drive. On average, semi-trucks get about 6.5 miles out of every fuel gallon. That performance varies greatly, however, depending on where you drive, how you drive and the age of the truck.</p>

<h2>Use the following steps to determine a truck’s miles per gallon fuel usage and costs:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Fill up your truck’s fuel tank completely. Record the number of gallons and the odometer reading. As an example, let’s say your truck takes 200 gallons of diesel and the odometer reads 68,000 miles.</li>
	<li>The next time you fuel up, write down the number of gallons it takes to completely fill the tank and the new odometer reading. In this example, you filled 190 gallons of diesel and the odometer now reads 69,083. Subtract the earlier odometer reading from the current reading to determine how many miles you drove on the last tank of diesel: 69,083 – 68,000 = 1,083.</li>
	<li>Divide the number of miles you drove by the number of gallons you just put into your tank: 1,083 divided by 190 equals 5.7. Your truck’s fuel efficiency is 5.7 miles per gallon.</li>
	<li>Now, you can calculate your per-mile fuel spending. Take the current per-gallon price of diesel ($2.10) and divide it by your truck’s miles per gallon. So, $2.10 divided by 5.7 equals 36.84 cents. If you round that number up, you are spending 37 cents on fuel for every mile your truck travels.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Determining Profitability</h2>

<p>With this information handy, you can more accurately calculate the profitability of different loads for you truck. For example, a dry van load from Dallas to Houston will pay your trucking company $1.89 per mile. Subtract the 37 cents per mile you expect to spend on fuel and you are looking at a $1.52 profit per mile before calculating driver pay and other costs. Keep in mind that a truck’s miles per gallon will change over time, depending on maintenance, the tires on the truck and the routes driven. The per-gallon cost of diesel, of course, is constantly rising or falling. Continuously tracking the fuel usage and expenses for each of your trucks will ensure greater accuracy in selecting loads and determining freight rates for your company.</p>

772,0,Blog Posts,Five Reasons Why Bad Drivers are Getting Worse,Five Reasons Why Bad Drivers are Getting Worse,"<p>Today’s motor vehicles are safer than ever before. Innovations like rearview cameras, electronic stability systems and collision avoidance systems are all designed to cut down on road accidents and injuries.</p>

<p>So why is the number of deaths on U.S. highways currently on the rise?</p>

<p>The reason, according to over-the-road truckers we spoke with in October, is poor driving. Many truck drivers believe the motoring public—whom they often refer to as “four-wheelers”—is driving more recklessly at higher speeds while paying less attention to large trucks and the road in general.</p>

<p>“They do not respect the size of (our trucks). They don’t give us the room we need and you know it’s just a matter of time before someone loses a life,” said John, a driver for Swift Transportation.</p>

<p>Recent U.S. highway statistics support that assertion. According to a report from the National Safety Council, 40,200 people died in accidents involving motor vehicles in 2016—a 6% increase over the previous year. Since 2014, the number of vehicle-related fatalities has increased a staggering 14%, the NSC reports.</p>

<p>Why are the roads and highways more dangerous today, and why is bad driving becoming more common? Here are five reasons:</p>

<h2>More Drivers</h2>

<p>As the U.S. population continues to grow, so has the number drivers on the roads. There were 218 million licensed drivers in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That represents a 9% increase over the number of U.S. drivers a decade ago. About 87% of the driving-age population (age 16 and over) has a driver’s license, according to U.S. Census figures.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, highways and bridges across the country continue to age with very little expansion to match the growth in drivers. Upgrading the nation’s road system would require a massive investment—the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates more than $1.5 trillion would be required to get the infrastructure up to speed by 2025. President Donald Trump has pledged spending $1 trillion in public and private money on infrastructure, but a specific plan has yet to take shape.</p>

<p>Until the infrastructure improves, truck drivers must share the roads with more drivers than ever before on a highway system developed in the 1960s and 70s. “We got a lot of infrastructure issues and we don’t have the political will to fix them,” said Mark, a driver who hauls boats for Werner Enterprises.</p>

<h2>More Distractions</h2>

<p>Recent data shows that cell phones continue to be a big distraction for drivers—and the problem appears to be getting worse. Popular apps like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and others are tempting American drivers to stare at their phones instead of the highway. In 2015, there were 391,000 injuries related to distracted drivers, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>

<p>Distracted driving has led to many single-vehicle accidents that were not nearly as common years ago. The Missouri Department of Transportation recently reported nearly 2,000 guardrail and cable barrier collisions in 2016—creating significant repair bills for the state. The reason for most of those accidents? Drivers were playing with their phones instead of watching the road.</p>

<h2>An Improving Economy</h2>

<p>A healthier U.S. economy is good news. However, it does lead to Americans driving more miles to shop, travel and commute to jobs.</p>

<p>During the current economic rebound, Americans are driving more than ever. Drivers of trucks, cars, minivans and SUVs put in a record 3.22 trillion miles on U.S. roadways last year, according to the Federal Highway Administration. All of that driving has led to more accidents, particularly during holidays when a record number of Americans are taking to the roads.</p>

<h2>Less Enforcement</h2>

<p>Safety officials and advocates believe that the single biggest cause of more deaths on U.S. highways has been an easing of traffic enforcement and laws. Budget cuts and fiscal problems in many states and cities have led to fewer patrol officers on the roads. That, in turn, has led to more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunk driving and speeding regulations. There are simply fewer deterrents today for Americans who speed or drive while impaired.</p>

<p>State lawmakers have been reluctant in recent years to impose more restrictive laws and penalties that could reduce the number of accidents, injuries and deaths. For example, not wearing a seat belt while driving is a only a secondary traffic offense in 18 states—meaning you have to be pulled over for another traffic violation in order for a law officer to also ticket you for failing to wear a seat belt.</p>

<h2>Higher Speeds</h2>

<p>Many states have raised their highway speed limits in recent years. Texas, for example, allows speeds of as much as 85 miles per hour in some remote areas. Twelve other states allow speeds as high as 75 miles per hour. An additional six states—all of them rural states in the west—have 80 mph speed limits.</p>

<p>Raising speed limits is popular with businesses and residents that want to go faster from point A to point B. However, higher speeds unmistakably lead to worse driving and more accidents. A recent study by <em>The Huffington Post</em> found that seven of the 10 states that lead the country in per-capita high deaths also allow highway speeds of 75 mph or greater.</p>

774,0,Blog Posts,The Eight Most Common Questions About ELDs,The Eight Most Common Questions About ELDs,"<p>During the countdown to the Dec. 18 deadline for ELD compliance, drivers and fleet owners still had a lot of questions about ELD mandate.</p>

<p>Below are eight frequent questions we at RTS Carrier Services hear while serving our trucking customers, followed by thorough, up-to-date answers.</p>

<h2>Q: Do all heavy trucks have to comply with the ELD rule?</h2>

<p>Most commercial motor vehicles will be required to have an ELD. Exemptions from the ELD rule include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fleets operating heavy trucks manufactured prior to the year 2000.</li>
	<li>Drivers who only use paper duty status records for eight days or less during a 30-day period.</li>
	<li>Drivers who do not have to keep a records-of-duty status.</li>
	<li>Vehicles that are also the product being delivered (drive-away/tow-away).</li>
	<li>Carriers that only perform short hauls within a 100-air-mile radius.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q: Does the ELD rule apply to owner-operators and small fleets?</h2>

<p>Yes, it does. Small carries and owner-operators that do not qualify for an exemption must equip their trucks with ELDs by Dec. 18.</p>

<h2>Q: Do hot shot trucking fleets have to use ELDs?</h2>

<p>The FMCSA provides an exemption from the ELD mandate for carriers with vehicles that do not require CDLs and operate within a 150-air-miles radius of their headquarters. To learn more about this exemption, visit the FMCSA website <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: How much will it cost me to equip my trucks with electronic logs?</h2>

<p>The cost of an ELD can vary widely, depending on what kinds of capabilities you want it to have. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has estimated that an ELD could cost anywhere from $165 to $832 per year, per truck. RTS Carrier Services’ partner, Transflo, offers two types of electronic logging devices that cost $25 or $35 per month. If you purchase Transflo’s Standard or Fleet Telematics ELDs through RTS Carrier Services, <a href=""https://www.rtscarrierservices.com/page/eld"">you can save $99 for each device</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: I have an electronic logging system, but it’s old. Do I have to get a new one?</h2>

<p>You may currently be using an automatic on-board recording device (AOBRD). If so, you have a little more time before you need to worry about upgrading to ELDs. The deadline when drivers using AOBRDs must comply with the new ELD regulation is Dec. 16, 2019.</p>

<h2>Q: Can I just log my hours on my phone?</h2>

<p>You can use your phone or tablet to help track hours-of-service, but you will also need an ELD physically installed in your truck. The hardware of the ELD device records engine data and driving activity. Your phone or tablet can be used to download compliant mobile application software that works with the ELD’s data to track drive time, duty status, driver breaks and other operational information.</p>

<h2>Q: How big a deal is this for trucking?</h2>

<p>The ELD mandate is expected to affect most of the trucking industry. The FMCSA estimates that 3.4 million commercial truck drivers must comply with the rule. Some studies have estimated that as many as 2 million trucks do not use any type of electronic logging today.</p>

<h2>Q: How will the government know whether I’m using ELDs or not?</h2>

<p>ELD non-compliance can be detected during a DOT audit or a roadside inspection. After Dec. 18, the penalties for not having an ELD can be stiff: fines of as much as $11,000 per incident, in addition to possible temporary or permanent shutdown orders.</p>

775,0,Blog Posts,How ELDs Can Help Your Trucking Company,How ELDs Can Help Your Trucking Company,"<p>Whether you agree with the ELD mandate or not, the new federal rule went into effect on Dec. 18, 2017—and will be enforced soon after that. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) has announced plans to begin putting trucking companies out of service for not having ELDs <a href=""http://www.ttnews.com/articles/trucks-without-elds-wont-be-placed-out-service-until-april-1-cvsa-says"">as early as April 1, 2018</a>.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of ELDs</h2>

<p>If your trucks need to be equipped with ELDs, it might help you to know that the devices can be much more than just an added business expense.</p>

<p>Most large trucking fleets have been logging their hours-of-service electronically for years. Below are some of the advantages that ELD technology has brought many of those carriers. Your company could eventually see these benefits as well.</p>

<h2>ELDs Reduce Paperwork</h2>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices"">Federal Motor Carrier Saftely Administration (FMCSA)</a>, truck drivers spend an average of 20 hours a year filling out logs and reporting their hours of service. The automation of ELDs eliminates all that paperwork, giving drivers more time to drive.</p>

<p>Electronic logging can add several hours a week of drive time because drivers can round up to the nearest minute for stops. Paper logbooks currently require rounding up to the nearest 15 minutes.</p>

<h2>Inspections Will Go Faster</h2>

<p>In the event of a roadside inspection, ELDs will make it easier for the inspecting officer to read the hours-of-service data. There will be no more sorting through a driver’s handwritten logbook. This should make inspections go faster and get your trucks back on the road a lot sooner.</p>

<h2>ELDs Help You Track Your Fleet</h2>

<p>The accuracy of electronic logging should make your trucking operation better-informed and more efficient. ELDs can help you monitor your trucks’ locations through GPS tracking, giving you real-time visibility to your fleet. This cuts down on the amount of time spent texting and calling drivers to learn their locations. Many ELDs can integrate with dispatch software, helping trucking companies plan shorter and more efficient routes. The results can include better fleet productivity and reduced costs of doing business.</p>

<h2>ELDs Eliminate Mistakes</h2>

<p>In tracking their hours-of-service on paper, drivers can sometimes make mistakes. It’s easy to enter the wrong time or location. Poor reporting in logbooks can catch up with a trucking company, leading to rising CSA scores and fines.</p>

<p>An ELD automatically calculates hours of service, IFTA fuel tax reporting and driver-vehicle inspection reports. Because the device is connected to a truck’s engine, it can also warn of any performance or maintenance issues. More accurate reporting from ELDs helps eliminate mistakes and keeps your trucks on the road.</p>

<h2>Your Trucks Can Log More Miles</h2>

<p>ELDs will be an added expense for your trucking company—the FMCSA estimates an average annual cost of $495 per device. However, ELDs can more than pay for themselves over time by making your fleet more productive and efficient.</p>

<p>With less paperwork and administration, your trucks can spend more time moving freight. With the engine diagnostics and GPS trucking that ELDs provide, your trucks should spend less time in the shops and at loading docks. In the long run, these efficiencies should generate more profits for your trucking company.</p>

<h2>You Can Save More on Fuel</h2>

<p>Because they track a truck engine’s activity, ELDs can tell you how much time your trucks are idling, just burning through diesel. Once you identify drivers who spend too much time idling, you can encourage them to adopt better driver habits. This can help reduce your company’s fuel consumption.</p>

<h2>ELDs will Keep Your Trucks on the Road</h2>

<p>The main incentive for adopting ELDs for your trucking company is that the technology will soon become mandatory. An out-of-service penalty from inspectors, even for a few hours, can be disastrous for a small carrier.</p>

<p>In addition to the other potential advantages they provide, ELDs can give you the peace of mind that your company is compliant with the new federal mandate. You won’t have to worry about the fines and penalties that non-compliant carriers may soon face.</p>

776,776,Blog Posts,12 Great Trucking Movies That Time Forgot,12 Great Trucking Movies That Time Forgot,"<p>The 1970s marked a golden age of movies about truck drivers. Classics like <em>Smokey and the Bandit</em>, <em>Every Which Way but Loose</em> and <em>Convoy</em> captured the adventure of the open road, inspiring more than a few people to get a commercial driver’s license and put money down on their first rig.</p>

<p>Burt Reynolds, Clint Eastwood and Kris Kristofferson set the standard for CB-talking truckers willing to dispense some down-home justice on corrupt sheriffs and businessmen, but there have been many other trucking heroes on the silver screen. Here are 12 trucker movies you might not have heard about but are well worth watching. Some of them can be downloaded in their entirety on YouTube:</p>

<h2><em>White Line Fever</em> (1975)</h2>

<p>This was one of the first films to celebrate the lifestyle of over-the-road trucking. Independent driver Carrol Jo takes on an evil corporation that is forcing truckers to haul illegal cigarettes and slot machines. The movie’s climactic scene involves car chases, heavily armed security guards and Carrol Jo’s 1974 Ford rig, nicknamed “Blue Mule.”</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> “White Line Fever” is a term describing the mental detachment truckers sometimes experience after hundreds of miles on the Interstate.</p>

<h2><em>Breaker! Breaker!</em> (1977)</h2>

<p>A clean-shaven Chuck Norris stars as a truck driver whose friend is attacked and paralyzed by a police officer. Norris and his fellow truckers seek revenge and expose a small-town scam involving a crooked judge and stolen cargo.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><em> Breaker! Breaker!</em> is Chuck Norris’ first starring role. He makes the most of it by destroying an entire town with his rig.</p>

<h2><em>High-Ballin’</em> (1978)</h2>

<p>Jerry Reed follows up his <em>Smokey and the Bandit</em> performance by playing a tough owner-operator named Iron Duke in this 1978 flick about trucker exploitation. Iron Duke and his sidekick, played by Peter Fonda, organize their trucker friends against a local fleet boss. Things start to go wrong when the pair try hauling illegal liquor to a lumper camp. Car crashes, gun fights and many explosions ensue.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Just like in <em>Smokey and the Bandit</em>, Jerry Reed wrote and sang this movie’s title track.</p>

<h2><em>The Great Smokey Roadblock</em> (1978)</h2>

<p>Henry Fonda plays a 60-year-old driver whose rig gets repossessed while he is in the hospital. He steals back his truck and does an old friend a favor by transporting six prostitutes across the state line.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Susan Sarandon plays one of the prostitutes. Robert Englund—later of Freddie Krueger fame—portrays a hitchhiker named Beebo.</p>

<h2><em>Over the Top</em> (1987)</h2>

<p>This Sylvester Stallone movie is about arm-wrestling, but it is also about trucking. Stallone plays a down-on-his-luck driver who enters a Las Vegas arm-wrestling contest in an attempt to start a new life. The grand prize is $100,000 and a brand new semi that the hero hopes to use to start his own fleet.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> <em>Over the Top</em> was a critical and commercial flop, but ranks high on IMDb’s list of “Epic Trucking Movies.”</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><em>Black Dog</em> (1998)</h2>

<p>Patrick Swayze is a truck driver and an ex-con who is tricked into hauling illegal firearms in a Peterbilt 379. Numerous attempts are made to hijack the load before Swayze hatches a plan that will get the FBI off his back and free his wife and daughter from a hostage situation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Meat Loaf and Randy Travis play supporting roles as Swayze hauls his load from Atlanta to New Jersey.</p>

<h2><em>Rolling Vengeance</em> (1987)</h2>

<p>Fans of 18-wheelers and <a href=""https://youtu.be/iQ8OEJyXUJ0"">monster trucks</a> will love this version of the classic trucker-gets-justice-the-only-way-he-can tale. Don Michael Paul plays a Canadian trucker who must avenge the murder of his parents and sisters by a corrupt family that is above the law. He naturally does this by constructing a massive, Big Foot-style truck that mows down everything—and everyone—in its path.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Ned Beatty, of <em>Superman</em> and <em>Deliverance</em> fame, stars as the evil bigwig responsible for killing off the trucker’s family.</p>

<h2><em>They Drive by Night</em> (1940)</h2>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZCbLFGYf9E""> thriller</a> starring George Raft and Humphrey Bogart may be the first trucker flick to gain mainstream success. Bogart and Raft star as brothers who run a one-truck business hauling goods in and out of Los Angeles. There’s murder, corruption, forbidden love and at least one truck bursting into flames as the brothers struggle to build their trucking company and stay out of trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Bogart was on the brink of a legendary career when he starred in <em>They Drive by Night</em>. Within the next few years, he’d have lead roles in classics like <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, <em>Casablanca</em> and <em>The Big Sleep</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Coast to Coast</em> (1980)</h2>

<p>Dyan Cannon stars as Madie, a well-to-do but neurotic woman who escapes a state mental hospital and meets a moody, over-the-road driver played by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7xgZCKr6Wc"">Robert Blake</a>. The trucker is reluctant to help Madie out until he secretly learns of the reward for returning her to the hospital. Somewhere along the Interstate between New York and California, the pair falls in love and wards off several bad guys along the way. The climactic scene involves a semi barreling through a lavish outdoor dinner party hosted by Madie’s greedy, no-good husband.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Blake earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actor of 1980 for his portrayal of trucker Charles Callahan.</p>

<h2><em>Maximum Overdrive</em> (1986)</h2>

<p>Horror and comedy converge in this <a href=""https://youtu.be/20BeizHnW3s"">movie directed by Stephen King</a>. Ex-con and truck stop employee Emilio Estevez uses firearms and rocket launchers to fight off a fleet of big-rigs that have strangely come to life. The ensuing battle scenes feature several classic vehicles, including a M274 Mule and a Western Star 4800 decked out in a giant Green Goblin mask.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> <em>Maximum Overdrive</em>’s soundtrack consists entirely of AC/DC songs, including “Hell’s Bells” and “You Shook Me All Night Long.”</p>

<h2><em>Christmas Comes to Willow Creek</em> (1987)</h2>

<p>Not all movie truck drivers are angry, revenge-seeking cowboys. Some of them are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de7yo4EtbJ8"">nice guys</a> just trying to help each other out. Tom Wopat and John Schneider star as brother truckers who must deliver Christmas presents to the troubled town of Willow Creek, Alaska. Along the way, the brothers contend with a severe blizzard as well as Schneider’s estranged wife, who is about to go into labor. Because <em>Christmas Comes to Willow Creek</em> is a made-for-TV Hallmark movie, a holiday miracle occurs and everything works out just fine in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> This movie was a reunion for Wopat and Schneider, who played outlaw cousins Bo and Luke in <em>The Dukes of Hazzard</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Hoffa</em> (1992)</h2>

<p>For decades, Jimmy Hoffa was one of the most influential men in the country as boss of the powerful Teamsters union. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTlAAEaxckQ"">This underrated movie</a> starring Jack Nicholson and directed by Danny DeVito follows Hoffa’s rise to union president, his under-the-table dealings with the Mafia and his mysterious 1975 disappearance. If you are interested in the history of the trucking industry, this film is a must-see.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Despite a big budget and an all-star cast, <em>Hoffa</em> was a flop with critics and moviegoers. Nicholson earned a Razzie nomination for Worst Actor of 1992.</p>

777,0,Blog Posts,Four Tips From The CVSA on Securing Your Cargo,Four Tips From The CVSA on Securing Your Cargo,"<p>On June 6-8, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance will conduct its annual, 72-hour International Roadcheck inspection blitz.</p>

<p>The emphasis of this year’s Roadcheck inspections will be cargo safety. The CVSA recently issued the following four tips for truck drivers to follow to ensure their loads are secure and compliant with safety regulations:</p>

<h2>1. Know the Rules</h2>

<p>As a driver, you need to become familiar with the regulations governing load securement in the countries where you operate and for the industries you serve. The following resources can get you up to speed on the latest rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s <a href=""http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/cargo-securement/cargo-securement-rules"">cargo securement rules.</a></li>
	<li>If you transport hazardous materials, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has load securement rules for hazardous cargo at <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov"">www.ecfr.gov.</a></li>
	<li>If you operate in Canada, securement standards from the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators can be found <a href=""http://www.ccmta.ca/en/national-safety-code/nsc-cargo-securement-standards"">here</a>.</li>
	<li>The CVSA’s handbooks on out-of-service criteria and cargo securement can be ordered on <a href=""http://www.CVSA.org"">www.CVSA.org</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Properly Secure Your Load and Equipment</h2>

<p>Safe cargo rules apply to more than just the load you are delivering. You must also secure and firmly immobilize anything else on your truck, including dunnage, tools, pallet jacks, spare tires and other equipment. Bungee cords and tarp straps must NOT be used as the primary securements for loads or equipment.</p>

<p>Also, remember that an enclosed van trailer alone may not sufficiently secure what you are carrying. Many larger or heavy loads need additional securement in an enclosed van to be safely secured.</p>

<h2>3. Carefully Inspect Tie-Downs for Wear and Damage</h2>

<p>Tie-downs must be secured in a way that prevents them from loosening, unfastening or releasing when your truck is moving. Over time, tie-downs can become worn or damaged, so make sure you regularly inspect them. If worn or damaged, tie-downs should be replaced immediately.</p>

<p>The CVSA’s North American Standard Out-of-Service Criteria includes a helpful tie-down defect table for chain, wire rope, cordage, synthetic webbing, steel strapping, fittings or attachments and anchor points.</p>

<h2>4. Establish Best Practices for Your Fleet</h2>

<p>If you operate a company with multiple trucks and drivers, it is important that everyone adopts the same practices in securing and inspecting cargo and equipment. Do some research on how other carriers that haul similar loads to yours handle cargo safety. Find out what works best for your fleet, but always make sure your loads are properly contained and immobilized so that shifting, leaking or falling off will not occur.</p>

<p>Loads that shift not only can cause crashes, but can also damage your trucks and equipment. Also, improper cargo and equipment securement can lead to citations that will affect your trucking company’s safety rating.</p>

778,0,Blog Posts,Avoid These Six Mistakes When You Select a Fuel Card,Avoid These Six Mistakes When You Select a Fuel Card,"<p>With numerous fuel card options to choose from, finding the best one for your trucking company can be a challenge.</p>

<p>Before committing to a fuel card program, make sure you’re avoiding these six mistakes that many carriers often make:</p>

<h2>Going with a Card Program That Costs Too Much</h2>

<p>The largest fuel card providers offer some advantages in terms of partnerships and fuel networks. They can also be more expensive. Some fuel cards often charge hefty transaction and membership fees, and pass along other costs of doing business to their customers. Before selecting any fuel card, be sure the expenses fit within your fleet’s budget.</p>

<h2>Making a Snap Decision When Selecting a Fuel Card</h2>

<p>Some trucking companies choose the first fuel card program that pops up on Google, and they soon come to regret it. As with any business decision, you need to be a smart consumer and do some homework. Take time to research several fuel cards. Compare pricing, terms, discount programs and other benefits, and select the best fit for your fleet and where your trucks run.</p>

<h2>Getting Stuck with a Limited Fuel Network</h2>

<p>You want a fuel card that provides maximum flexibility on where your trucks can fuel up. Choosing a fuel card that has a regional network or that partners with only one fuel retailer could severely limit how much your company can save on diesel.</p>

<h2>Overlooking Fees, Terms and Other Commitments</h2>

<p>Before entering an agreement, make sure you fully understand everything about the fuel card program. What are the fees? How long is the term of the contract? How do you receive your discount? What other benefits does the program offer? Who do you call when you run into a problem? Knowing all this up front will make for a better relationship with your fuel card provider.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Card That Doesn’t Include a Line of Credit</h2>

<p>Having a fuel card with a weekly line of credit helps keep your trucks running, addressing any unforeseen expenses on the road. A fuel card credit line can also generate cash flow during times when shipper demand is low.</p>

<h2>Ignoring Other Benefits Beyond Fuel Savings</h2>

<p>A fuel card may offer good diesel discounts, but what else can it do for you? When researching fuel card programs, look for ones than can help your company save on other expenses like maintenance, tires, document scanning and tax reporting. A fuel card that offers many ways to save is usually a better long-term resource.</p>

779,0,Blog Posts,What to Expect in Your DOT Physical Exam,What to Expect in Your DOT Physical Exam,"<p>Since 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation has required truck drivers to get a physical examination at least once every two years. If you have a commercial driver’s license, you must have a valid Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration medical certification from an FMCSA-approved medical examiner.</p>

<p>Like any visit with a doctor, getting a DOT physical requires a little bit of planning and preparation. Sometimes, it can be difficult finding time away from the road to schedule an appointment. One solution might be <a href=""http://www.rtscarrierservices.com/page/medical-clinics"">UrgentCareTravel (UCT)</a>, a growing network of medical clinics that are conveniently located at different Pilot Flying J travel centers across the country. Members of RTS Carrier Services who enroll in UCT’s RTS PRIME program will pay only $25 for an initial DOT physical and save as much as 30% on future medical visits.</p>

<p>Regardless of where you get your DOT physical, here are some tips to make sure the examination is as successful and hassle-free as possible:</p>

<h2>Find the Right Practitioner</h2>

<p>The person who administers your exam does not have to be a doctor, but he or she must be registered as a medical examiner with the FMCSA. Before scheduling your appointment, look for the nearest provider who is <a href=""https://nationalregistry.fmcsa.dot.gov/NRPublicUI/home.seam"">listed here on the FMCSA’s online National Registry</a>.</p>

<h2>Plan Ahead</h2>

<p>The success of your DOT physical depends greatly on how well you prepare. Get a good night’s rest before the exam and do not rush to the appointment, as that can lead to a higher blood pressure reading. Drink plenty of water before the appointment, and avoid caffeine and nicotine. Remember to bring your driver’s license, have the names and dosages of your medications, and be able to provide contact information for your primary physician.</p>

<p>It also helps to know when your current medical certification expires. Make a reminder in your smartphone’s calendar to alert you one month before the expiration date. That will help you plan for when and where to schedule your next DOT physical.</p>

<h2>Take Your Medicine</h2>

<p>If you are on medication, routinely take it as your doctor has prescribed. Having a disease or chronic condition under control results in a better physical, allowing you to carry a valid medical card for a longer period of time.</p>

<h2>Know What to Expect</h2>

<p>The exam will test your hearing, vision and blood pressure. You will also be required to provide a urine sample. Below are some of the other areas the DOT physical covers.</p>

<ul>
	<li>General appearance: signs of obesity, alcoholism or drug use</li>
	<li>Mouth and throat: deformities likely to interfere with breathing</li>
	<li>Sleep apnea: various tests to detect obstruction of the airway</li>
	<li>Chest and abdomen: abnormal breathing or enlarged organs</li>
	<li>Mobility: strength and flexibility in limbs and back</li>
</ul>

<h2>Be Honest About Your Health</h2>

<p>If you are not forthcoming about your condition, the medical exam and card might be deemed invalid. If you are not up-front with the practitioner about any health issues, the exam could take longer to complete. Remember that the exam also includes providing access to your medical records, so being open and honest from the start is always the best approach.</p>

<h2>Keep a Record of Your Exam</h2>

<p>A DOT physical exam can be valid for as long as 24 months. However, the medical examiner may issue a medical card for a shorter period of time if you have a condition that requires monitoring, like high blood pressure.</p>

<p>When you pass the physical exam, the medical examiner will give you a copy of the test results that you can use for documentation. The practitioner will also keep a copy of your Medical Examiner’s Certificate on file for at least three years.</p>

<p>Additional information about the DOT physical can be found <a href=""https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/""> here on the FMCSA's web site</a>.</p>

780,0,Blog Posts,Some Facts You Might Not Know About the E-Log Mandate,Some Facts You Might Not Know About the E-Log Mandate,"<p>Most drivers and carriers have heard about the new regulation requiring commercial trucks to have electronic logging devices (ELDs). The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) approved the final ELD rule last December, giving most independent owner-operators and trucking fleets two years to comply.</p>

<p>Federal regulators say electronic logs will cut down on driver fatigue by making it nearly impossible to cheat on hours-of-service rules. Many trucking companies and industry groups oppose the rule, calling it an unnecessary financial burden that will force some carriers out of business.</p>

<p>Regardless of the controversy, most over-the-road trucking companies must now install ELDs if they do not already use them. Here are some facts about the ELD mandate that you might have overlooked, but are important to know:</p>

<h2>Key Dates</h2>

<p>The ELD rule went into effect on February 16, 2016—60 days after the rule was published in the Federal Register. The compliance date for the rule—meaning the date when drivers and carriers must have electronic logs—is Dec. 18, 2017.</p>

<p>Trucking companies that currently use automatic onboard recording devices (AORDs) have two additional years to replace them with ELDs. For those fleets, the compliance date is Dec. 16, 2019.</p>

<h2>Exemptions from the Rule</h2>

<p>Not every fleet needs to worry about installing e-logs in its truck cabs. The ELD rule does not apply to the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any commercial trucks that are older than the model year 2000.</li>
	<li>Regional and local carriers that operate within 100 miles of their terminals.</li>
	<li>Drive-away or tow-away businesses that typically transport new or used trucks from factories to dealerships.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technological Requirements</h2>

<p>To comply with the new rule, an ELD must be able to transfer information one of two ways: through wireless web services and email, or Bluetooth and USB 2.0. Also, ELDs must be able to provide a printout or display of data during a roadside inspection, in the event of poor connectivity.</p>

<p>The FMCSA is allowing ELD makers to decide if they meet the various product specifications that the agency requires. However, some manufacturers may fudge a little bit when self-certifying their products. Before purchasing an ELD, do some research to make sure the device meets the FMCSA’s technological requirements. Just because an ELD is registered with the FMCSA does not mean it is fully compliant with the new rule.</p>

<h2>Supporting Documents Still Required</h2>

<p>Even though ELDs are meant to move trucking to a paperless system, drivers must still keep some paperwork on hand. The ELD rule requires drivers to keep no more than eight “supporting documents” from a trip for at least eight days. This documentation can include dispatch records, trip records, expense receipts, settlement sheets and other dated materials. The purpose of the documents is to help link a driver and dates to specific trips and on-duty hours.</p>

<h2>Anti-Harassment Protection</h2>

<p>The new ELD rule includes strong language forbidding carriers from “harassing” their drivers into violating hours-of-service rules. If harassment or the tampering of an ELD’s logs occurs, the carrier could face civil penalties, as well as intervention from other agencies like the Department of Labor.</p>

<p>Under the ELD mandate, carriers must follow the anti-harassment measures before ELDs become required in December 2017.</p>

782,0,Blog Posts,Vortex Generators: An Inexpensive Way to Improve Aerodynamics,Vortex Generators: An Inexpensive Way to Improve Aerodynamics,"<p>There are many products available today that can help your fleet improve its fuel economy. Side skirts, boat tails, gap fairings and rolling-resistant tires can contribute to significant savings at the pump. However, all of these products are expensive. It could take more than a year for your fleet to generate a return on its investment into new tires or the latest aerodynamic device.</p>

<p>One way to save money on fuel without breaking your budget is to purchase vortex generators for your fleet. Originally developed for airplanes, vortex generators are small aerodynamic devices that can be positioned on a tractor or a trailer. The devices work in tandem to help maintain steady airflow when the truck is moving. This reduces wind resistance and aerodynamic “drag,” key factors in how much fuel trucks use. As explained in <a href="" http://www.rtscarrierservices.com/article/how-better-aerodynamics-lead-fuel-savings"">our article about aerodynamics</a>, more than 50% of a tractor-trailer’s fuel use goes toward reducing drag when traveling at highway speeds.</p>

<p>The two leading vortex generators for commercial trucks today are Airtabs and VorBlade Cab and Trailer Systems. Both help reduce fuel consumption and many truck drivers maintain that the products also provide stability in windy or slick weather.</p>

<h2>Working in Tandem to Reduce Drag</h2>

<p>Developed by Canadian manufacturer Aeroserve Technologies Ltd., Airtab Fuel Savers are wishbone-shaped devices that can cut down on aerodynamic pressure on the cab and the trailer. Airtabs are designed to be mounted four inches apart from each other near the tractor-trailer gap and at the back of the trailer. The Airtabs create swirls of air that bridge the space between the tractor and trailer, and allow air to flow more smoothly in the back of the vehicle as well.</p>

<p>The makers of Airtab claim that carriers can save between 2% and 5% on fuel just by using Airtabs alone. The product is among the least expensive ways that fleet owners can improve aerodynamic performance. A single Airtab costs $2.75. A pack of 80 Airtabs retails at $220.</p>

<h2>A Quick Return on Investment</h2>

<p>VorBlade’s vortex generators were originally developed by physicists for the aviation industry. Re-designed for large trucks, the VorBlade Cab and Trailer System can reduce the impact of crosswinds by 60%. Research by the Texas Transportation Institute and the Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay program found that the full system can save as much as 9.5% on fuel consumption. VorBlade recommends that the product be installed on the cab and along the length of the trailer. Even when used only on the cab, VorBlade claims the devices can save as much as 3.76% on fuel.</p>

<p>With curved blades contained inside a rectangular structure, the VorBlade device looks quite different from an Airtab. Still, both products work similarly, as they are arranged in rows to cut down on turbulence around a truck. VorBlade promises that fuel savings from its product will deliver a return on investment within three months. An individual VorBlade device costs $7.90, while a fuel system for one tractor-trailer is priced at $875.</p>

<h2>Smoother and Safer</h2>

<p>Some truck drivers debate the overall impact that VorBlades or Airtabs have on fuel economy. However, most drivers agree that both products contribute to a significantly smoother and safer ride. The devices break down the curling airflow around a moving truck and reduce crosswinds. That improves the stability of the trailer in windy weather and makes it safer to change lanes. Vortex generators also reduce the amount of spray between the tractor and trailer in the rain and snow, making it easier for drivers to see through their side-view mirrors.</p>

783,0,Blog Posts,Important Questions to Ask When Evaluating a Trucking Rewards Program,Important Questions to Ask When Evaluating a Trucking Rewards Program,"<p>Regardless of the size of your trucking fleet, it makes good business sense to participate in a rewards program. All major truck stop chains, including Pilot Flying J, Love’s and TA/Petro, have cards that reward you with redeemable “points” for fueling up at their locations. With the right set of rewards, your drivers can save a significant amount of money on everything from food to showers while they are on the road.</p>

<p>Not all rewards programs are equal. As a fleet owner, you need to examine which program is the best fit for your company. Researching the Internet and asking other truckers what rewards card they recommend are good initial steps. However, you may need to dig a little deeper in assessing which program offers the greatest value for your company.</p>

<p>Here are six key questions to help guide your evaluation of a rewards program:</p>

<h2>How much can you save on fuel?</h2>

<p>Truck stop chains developed rewards cards as an incentive for commercial drivers to fuel up, eat and buy merchandise at their locations. With a rewards card, you accumulate points for all the gallons of diesel you purchase from a particular chain. You can then redeem those points to buy food and products anywhere in the chain’s network of fuel stops.</p>

<p>Your selection of a rewards card should go hand-in-hand with the best discounts you receive on your fuel card. For example, if a particular travel center chain offers you savings of 9 cents per gallon through your fuel card, it makes sense to accumulate points through that chain’s rewards card. The result is a classic win-win—you are saving money on fuel and earning rewards for other purchases as well.</p>

<h2>How large is the network?</h2>

<p>In addition to fuel savings, you need to research the size of a truck stop chain’s network before committing to its rewards card. Ideally, the chain will have hundreds of locations to choose from in the region where your fleet operates. Having that coverage is important because purchasing diesel at stops where you don’t earn rewards will indirectly cost your company money. Also, most truck stop chains offer greater rewards the more gallons you purchase in a given month.</p>

<h2>How do you earn and redeem points?</h2>

<p>Most truck stop chains reward one point—equal to $0.01—for each gallon of fuel purchased. However, the chains vary greatly in how you can use those points. Some require redeeming points via coupons. In other cases you may have to accumulate hundreds of points before you can use them to make a purchase. Always read the fine print for each rewards card you consider—many have points that expire if they are not used within a year.</p>

<p>Your drivers are too busy to deal with a lot of rules regarding points. The rewards program that has the fewest qualifiers for using points is often your best option.</p>

<h2>How are the tiers structured?</h2>

<p>Most rewards programs are tiered based on the amount of fuel your drivers purchase. For example, purchasing more than 1,000 gallons per month may elevate your fleet to a level in which it earns “double points” for each gallon.</p>

<p>When assessing rewards programs, consider the size of your fleet and how much fuel it purchases in a given month or even a year. A rewards card offering tiers that your company can realistically reach could be the right choice.</p>

<h2>What other perks are offered?</h2>

<p>Does an awards program offer products, services and partnerships that are meaningful to your drivers? For example, clean showers, good coffee and modern conveniences like free WiFi are all essentials to a long OTR haul. Additional perks like special rewards during a birthday month or discounts at popular restaurant chains can also add to a card’s appeal. Choosing a good rewards program might not just save your company money, it might help you retain drivers at a time when industry turnover is at a record high.</p>

<p>Some programs provide specific benefits that are tied directly to the number of gallons your drivers purchase. Many rewards cards provide a credit for a free shower for every 50 gallons purchased. These credits add up as the gallons accumulate. Free access to clean, available showers is an important benefit to truck drivers. Look for a rewards card that offers the best shower program.</p>

<h2>How good is the service?</h2>

<p>Finally, you should choose a rewards program that aligns your fleet with a truck stop chain that provides consistent, reliable service across all locations. The chain you select will have a significant impact on your drivers’ satisfaction and quality of life on the road. Are the bathrooms and showers clean? Are the clerks friendly and helpful? Does the chain offer quality food, plenty of parking and a wide range of products? Ask for your drivers’ opinions about certain truck stops, and use that feedback to inform your decision on a rewards card.</p>

784,0,Blog Posts,How Better Aerodynamics Lead to Fuel Savings,How Better Aerodynamics Lead to Fuel Savings,"Accidentally made a dupe article.

<p>Improving the aerodynamics of tractor-trailers has become a big issue in recent years. This is because heavy trucks burn a lot of diesel as they push up against air resistance. When an 18-wheeler travels on the highway, more than 50% of its fuel use goes toward reducing aerodynamic “drag.”</p> 

<p>Cutting the drag on trucks will also cut down fuel consumption. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California is studying ways to improve the fuel economy of tractor-trailers. In 2017, the lab and truck manufacturer Navistar designed a SuperTruck prototype that gets 13 miles per gallon and has 104% improved fuel efficiency. Nearly half of the truck’s fuel consumption improvements come from aerodynamic enhancements.</p> 

<p>Lawrence Livermore researchers believe that aerodynamics developed in its partnership with Navistar could save the trucking industry 21 billion gallons of diesel fuel per year.</p>  

<h2>Streamlining Your Fleet</h2>

<p>What this means for your fleet is that adding the right aerodynamic devices can generate significant savings at the pump. Not all devices are equal in making the air smoother around a Class 8 rig as it barrels down the interstate. It is important to know what improvements reduce the most drag—and save the most fuel.</p> 

<p>Four areas create the most aerodynamic drag on a tractor-trailer: the front of the tractor, the gap between the tractor and the trailer, the under-body of the trailer and the back of the trailer. Trucking companies added streamlined shields to the tops of truck cabs to save on gas after the oil embargos of the 1970s. In recent years, “side skirts” that reduce the air flow under trailers have become a common sight on the highway. Some trucking companies are now experimenting with devices that cut drag in the tractor-trailer gap and in the rear of the trailer.</p> 

<h2>Proven Methods</h2>

Here are the most effective steps you can take to make your trucks more aerodynamic and fuel efficient, according to industry experts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrow the Gap.</strong> Research shows that a gap of 18 inches or more between the tractor and trailer could lead to increased air resistance. Devices that completely cover the gap can reduce aerodynamic drag by as much as 6%. Several gap-fairing products on the market advertise fuel savings of 2% by narrowing the gap.</p>
<li><strong>“Skirt” the Issue.</strong> Many trucking companies have adopted side skirts. By reducing the air underneath trailers, fuel savings of between 4% and 7% have been reported by side skirt manufacturers.</p>
<li><strong>Reduce Tail Winds.</strong> Wind tunnel and road tests show that adding a 24- to 32-inch “boat tail” can reduce turbulence behind a trailer’s square rear end. According to manufacturers, boat tails can save more than 6% on fuel for tractor-trailers traveling at 65 miles per hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other devices like wheel covers, slotted mud flaps and vortex generators lead to modest reductions in drag. These improvements alone do not lead to significant fuel savings.</p>

<h2>A Cumulative Effect</h2>

Aerodynamic modifications add up to significant fuel savings when they are implemented together. Fleet owners who install gap fairings, side skirts and boat tails on their trucks can increase their fuel efficiency by 14% or more, according to industry sources. The cost of adding these devices is quickly offset by savings at the pump. A company that spends $1 million each year on fuel, for example, could expect to save more than $140,000 a year. 

<h2>Trucks of the Future</h2>

<p>Tesla created waves in 2017 with the unveiling of its electric semi-truck. However, the Tesla Semi won’t go into production until 2019. At a minimum cost of $150,000 per truck, the electric truck will be too pricey for all but the largest trucking fleets.</p>

<p>Fortunately, fleet owners can take advantage of newer truck models that are much less expensive and cut down significantly on fuel consumption. New highway tractors that have 6x2 power configurations—as opposed to the standard 6x4 configuration—have consistently shown a 2.5% increase in miles per gallon.  At a time when most tractor-trailers on the road average about 6 miles per gallon, some new trucks now achieve 9 mpg or slightly more. Truck and engine manufacturers continue to develop more streamlined models. Peterbilt and Cummins for example, are collaborating in the U.S. Department of Energy’s SuperTruck II initiative in an effort to meet future emissions standards and increase fuel efficiency.</p>
 
<p>In the years before electronic and self-driving vehicles become a significant share of the market, the next wave of streamlined semi-trucks could save fleets tens of thousands of dollars in fuel spending.</p>

787,0,Blog Posts,Why Fuel Prices Vary From State to State,Why Fuel Prices Vary From State to State,"<p>It is a well-known fact in the trucking industry that prices on diesel fuel are different in each state and often in each city. You may wonder why fuel prices vary so greatly by region or section of the country. Taxes are a major reason, but there are other factors as well.</p>

<p>Below are five key reasons why fuel prices can be vastly different from one stop to the next along your route:</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>

<p>The biggest reason for the variance in fuel prices is that states tax gasoline at different rates. The rate often depends on how much money each state needs to raise in highway funding. Other issues like emissions regulations play a role as well.</p>

<p>According to the American Petroleum Institute, California this year has the highest rate at 106.1 cents per diesel gallon in combined state and federal taxes, followed by Pennsylvania at 99.5 cents. The state with the lowest tax rate is Alaska, at 36.7 cents per diesel gallon.</p>

<h2>Emissions Standards</h2>

<p>Refineries throughout the United States have to create more than 50 blends of gas to meet different city and state standards. Many cities and states require cleaner-burning fuel that emits less pollution into the environment. Producing so many different fuel grades adds operating cost to refineries and distributors. That cost is passed along to consumers and carriers.</p>

<p>Chicago has some of the strictest fuel emissions standards in the country and is often the city with the most expensive fuel prices. Cities with fewer restrictions like Charleston, S.C. often rank among areas in the U.S. with the cheapest fuel.</p>

<h2>Crude Oil Prices</h2>

<p>The price of fuel often reflects the level of oil production and the challenge in transporting crude oil from its drilling source to a refinery.</p>

<p>Today the oil drilling business is booming again, as U.S. oil production has surged to levels not seen since the early 1970s. Therefore, the price of crude oil is cheaper in states where it is produced or refined like Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Louisiana. However, other areas of the country do not have access to that oil. Fuel prices and taxes tend to be steeper in areas like the Northeast and West Coast, which rely more on imported oil.</p>

<h2>Pipelines</h2>

<p>The nation’s pipeline infrastructure is the most effective way to transport crude oil from drillers to refineries. Until recently, the pipelines have lacked capacity to serve domestic fuel production, which contributes to the variances in diesel prices.</p>

<p>That challenge is now being addressed. In 2014, TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone Pipeline opened its south leg between Oklahoma and Texas. That leg can pump as much as 800,000 gallons of crude oil a day to refineries along the Gulf Coast. The pipeline has helped even out fuel prices between the country’s geographic center and the coasts.</p>

<p>TransCanada plans to begin work in 2019 on its new Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline, which was first proposed in 2008, would ship 830,000 barrels of crude per day from Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota, to Nebraska. From there, it would connect with Keystone’s south leg, carrying crude to the Gulf Coast refineries.</p>

<p>Environmentalists and other groups strongly opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, so there could be more delays to its development. However, TransCanada has announced it has enough commitments from oil producers now to build the new pipeline.</p>

<h2>Supply and Demand</h2>

<p>Fuel prices are affected by various market factors that include refinery maintenance, the switch-over to summer blend gas and fluctuations in consumer demand. In most states, fuel consumption peaks in the summer travel months of July and August and is lower during the winter months.</p>

788,0,Blog Posts,How Tires Affect Fuel Efficiency for Trucking Companies,How Tires Affect Fuel Efficiency for Trucking Companies,"<p>Can the right set of tires really help you save a significant amount of money on fuel?</p>

<p>The answer is yes. The amount of energy your tires exert while rolling under a full load can greatly affect the fuel consumption of your truck.</p>

<h2>How Tires Save Fuel</h2>

<p>Tires are not the biggest factor when it comes to paying less at the pump, but they represent an easy way to make your truck more fuel-friendly. How do tires make a difference? It is a matter of simple physics. Rolling resistance—the pressure that a rolling tire puts on the road—is one force that works against your truck’s speed. Other factors include air resistance, friction loss in the engine and steep inclines. Some experts report that as much as a third of a truck’s fuel consumption is caused by tire rolling resistance. When factoring in cars and other vehicles, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 5% to 15% of U.S. fuel consumption is related to rolling resistance.</p>

<p>Any improvement made to the rolling resistance of a truck does not directly correlate with the amount saved on fuel, but it does help. A 5% improvement in rolling resistance might translate into around 2% less fuel consumed. As trucks have become more aerodynamic in design, rolling resistance has had a smaller impact on fuel use, but it is still significant. For a company that spends $500,000 annually on fuel, that 2% reduction means saving $10,000 a year.</p>

<h2>Getting the Most from Your Tires</h2>

<p>So how do you lower rolling resistance and lower your fuel costs? Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Traction matters.</strong> Back in the days before rising oil prices, heavier traction was an attractive quality. Tires with deep treads and lug patterns were popular then. The fuel-efficient tires of today offer less traction and rolling resistance but do not limit a truck’s safe operation. Studies show that even a switch from duel tires to wide-base singles does not compromise safe driving in hazardous conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Older tires can be more efficient than new ones.</strong> That is because their treads are not as deep. As a tread wears down, the fuel efficiency of the tire usually increases due to less traction. The second half of your tires’ tread life can save you more money than the first half.</li>
	<li><strong>Uneven tire pressure can add expense.</strong> Proper inflation for a given tire size and truckload will reduce the flexing, stress and build-up in the tire that lead to wasteful fuel use. The casing of the tire is important as well. Even retreaded casings that retain fuel efficiency can be effective.</li>
	<li><strong>Not all axles are the same.</strong> The amount of rolling resistance per axle is equal to the amount of weight that axle bears. Therefore, the trailer axles on a tractor-trailer offer the best chance of fuel savings.</li>
	<li><strong>It pays to do research.</strong> Every tire company offers a fuel-efficient product for trucks. Take the time to surf the Web for customer reviews, independent studies and price comparisons to make sure you find the right set of tires for your fuel-saving needs.</li>
</ul>

789,0,Blog Posts,What Truck Drivers Should Know About the Medical Certification Rules,What Truck Drivers Should Know About the Medical Certification Rules,"<p>New nationwide rules governing how commercial drivers receive their medical certification took effect in 2014. Going forward, all U.S. Department of Transportation physicals must be performed by a member of the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reported that more than 22,000 medical professionals were on the national registry, with another 27,000 expected to be added. The registry can be found on the <a href=""http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov"">FMCSA’s web site</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some important facts every driver should know about the new medical certificate rules:</p>

<h2>Current certifications still work</h2>

<p>Medical certificates held by commercial drivers are valid until the expiration date shown on the card. At that time, drivers need to find a certified medical examiner to perform the next physical.</p>

<h2>New certifications are valid for two years</h2>

<p>There are exceptions for medical conditions like hypertension, heart disease or abnormal blood pressure. Drivers with those conditions may need to renew their certifications on a yearly basis.</p>

<h2>Proof is required</h2>

<p>Drivers will need to keep a copy of their medical certificate with them when operating a commercial truck. A proposed FMCSA rule requiring medical examiners to electronically file medical exam results once a month will mean a driver only has to carry a copy of his or her certification for 15 days after the physical.</p>

<h2>Medical examiners have authority</h2>

<p>The FMCSA rules allow a medical examiner to determine if a driver is fit to operate commercial trucks. Even if a driver has a condition that is being treated by prescribed medicine, the medical examiner may decide that medication poses a safety risk. If a driver has a condition deemed hazardous to operating a truck, the medical examiner may decline to issue a certification until the condition is treated.</p>

<h2>Drivers must be truthful</h2>

<p>Each driver is held accountable for information provided about his or her health history. Drivers may face a civil penalty for making false statements about their health.</p>

<h2>Employers do not have to pay</h2>

<p>The new rules do not require a driver’s employer to pay for the medical examination. The cost of an exam is determined by the medical examiner.</p>

<h2>Employers could be notified</h2>

<p>The FMCSA does not prohibit the medical examiner from sharing a driver’s medical information with the driver’s employer. The regulatory requirements take precedence over the privacy rule in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p>

<h2>Driving performance does not matter</h2>

<p>A driver’s experience or past driving record has no bearing on his or her eligibility for the medical certificate.</p>

<h2>Exemptions are available for certain conditions</h2>

<p>A driver can be exempt from the medical certification rules if the FMCSA determines it is in the public interest. The FMCSA currently offers exemption programs for vision and insulin-treated diabetes mellitus. There is also a certificate program for drivers who have prosthetic limbs. A driver can also receive a waiver if he or she has a temporary medical condition and taking the medical exam at that time would make it unreasonably difficult to operate a commercial vehicle.</p>

790,0,Blog Posts,Best Practices for Hiring and Retaining Drivers,Best Practices for Hiring and Retaining Drivers,"<p>Hiring and keeping qualified drivers is a challenge for even the largest trucking fleets. Trucking companies continue to list “driver shortage” as a major concern, while driver turnover rates sit fairly high. And replacing drivers who leave costs an estimated $5,000 per driver, according to the ATA. To help with the hiring and retention of good drivers, start by investing some time and effort into these areas:</p>

<h2>Explore new payment methods</h2>

<p>You need to be more creative than just paying your drivers by the mile. The average per-mile pay rates for most trucking modes have barely increased in the last decade. Many trucking companies are now recruiting drivers by offering performance and sign-on bonuses. Some fleets offer as much as $6,000 upfront to hire an experienced driver. Another approach is scrapping per-mile pay entirely in favor of hourly pay. That way drivers are paid for everything they do, including loading and unloading. This approach can also promote safer driving. If you are not paying by the mile, the driver will not be in a rush to deliver a load and move on to the next haul.</p>

<h2>Create performance incentives</h2>

<p>You want employees who work hard, arrive on time and drive safely. Why not reward those behaviors? Some trucking companies have found success in offering drivers bonuses every six months for meeting fuel efficiency and safety goals. This is a win for both the drivers and the fleet owner. Good driving habits help reduce fuel and equipment costs, improving your company’s bottom line.</p>

<h2>Give them the tools they need</h2>

<p>Do what you can to ensure each driver’s success. Develop an orientation program that trains new drivers on how your company operates. Provide a warm welcome by introducing drivers to everyone on your staff. If possible, pair each new driver with a mentor within your organization. Steps like these can increase drivers’ comfort levels with your company and build greater loyalty.</p>

<h2>Provide good benefits</h2>

<p>The cost of health insurance is a huge concern to all employers. Many trucking companies are now passing the expense of insurance premiums along to their employees. Paying for your employees’ coverage can set your company apart. You can attract young, healthy drivers who do not want part of their paychecks to go toward health insurance they seldom use.</p>

<p>Other benefits like paid vacation days, sick days and 401(k)’s will appeal to drivers who have families. Programs that offer employees some equity in your company like an Employee Stock Ownership Plan are another option. As a small fleet owner, you will need to prioritize the benefits you offer your people. Give some thought to the kinds of drivers you want for your company and fashion an attractive benefits package around their needs.</p>

<h2>Budget some money toward retention</h2>

<p>Instead of spending $5,000 each time you replace a driver, set aside some of that money for initiatives that help recruit and retain the best drivers.</p>

<h2>Make them feel valued</h2>

<p>All truck drivers have horror stories about companies that demand long hours with moderate pay and no respect. Do not become one of those companies. Build a team-oriented culture that embraces your drivers. Offer drivers the same benefits and perks that you provide your office employees. Keep an open line of communication with drivers and solicit their ideas. When a driver has a problem, address it promptly. Show you care about your drivers’ family lives by providing perks like two days of home time after every 3,000 miles of service.</p>

<p>With today’s capacity shortage, good pay and benefits are not enough to retain the best drivers on your team. Drivers want to be valued and to play a part in your company’s growth.</p>

791,0,Blog Posts,Five Reasons Not to Worry about Self-Driving Trucks,Five Reasons Not to Worry about Self-Driving Trucks,"<p>As you may know, a lot has happened lately with autonomous technology in the trucking industry.</p>

<p>Manufacturers like Volvo, Daimler, Tesla and Otto have developed and are testing self-driving trucks. Even companies like Walmart and Amazon are already rolling out autonomous trucks. Proponents of automated vehicles tout how they will make trucking freight safer, cheaper and more efficient, helping to smooth out supply chain gaps. An article in the <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-automated-trucks-labor-20160924/""><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> predicted that over 1.7 million truck driving jobs could be eliminated by automation within the next decade.</p>

<p>Worried yet? Don’t be.</p>

<p>The development of trucks that can drive themselves is a concern for the trucking industry, but a lot of things must happen to make autonomous semi-trucks a major force in the industry. Below are five reasons why you shouldn’t worry too much about self-driving trucks taking over the roads anytime soon:</p>

<h2>The Government has to Get Involved</h2>

<p>More than fifteen states have laws on the books that relate to self-driving vehicles. Ultimately, though, the federal government will set the rules that allow for the safe movement of autonomous, 80,000-pound trucks across the country. Self-driving trucks will be regulated by the <a href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety"">Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA).</p>

<p>In September 2019, the House of Representatives passed a bill that will lift many restrictions on introducing self-driving cars to the nation’s highways. The U.S. Senate is considering a similar measure. While automated commercial trucks are not currently included in those bills, they <a href=""http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/mobility/2017/09/28/senate-drops-trucks-self-driving-vehicle-bill/106090046/"">could be added to a different piece of legislation</a>.</p>

<p>Not including heavy-duty trucks in a sweeping self-driving vehicle bill would be a setback for truck manufacturers. Companies like Daimler and Uber (which owns self-driving truck maker Otto), could still develop new technology, but would be limited to testing those trucks in the handful of U.S. states that currently allow them.</p>

<h2>Driving a Heavy-Duty Truck Requires Skill and Intuition</h2>

<p>If you have driven a commercial truck, you understand how challenging it can be. Can a robot mimic the complex maneuvers truck drivers must make to weave their way through a busy port or back up to a loading dock? Even on an Interstate, will artificial intelligence be able to negotiate construction zones, mountain passes or bad weather?</p>

<p>“What happens if a steer tire blows out? Humans are very good at intuitively assessing a situation and responding. Computers need to have all that lined up for them, all those edge cases,” Derek Rotz, director of advanced engineering for Daimler, <a href=""https://www.trucks.com/2017/07/13/self-driving-trucks-3-4-years/"">told Trucks.com in June</a>.</p>

<p>Someday, machines may be sophisticated enough to handle all the nuances of driving a heavy truck. That breakthrough is likely many years away, however.</p>

<h2>Self-Driving Trucks Will Need Someone in the Cab</h2>

<p>Most experts agree that the level of automation for heavy-duty trucks will come in pieces over the next several years. Once autonomous trucks take to the roads, they will still require tech-savvy drivers monitoring the controls. For example, a Level 4 autonomous vehicle, which could be rolled out commercially in the next three or four years, can drive itself in most situations, but will need a human to take the wheel in the event of bad weather or construction. A Level 5 autonomous vehicle, which the NHTSA describes as one that needs no human help, is still many years away from becoming commercially viable.</p>

<h2>Autonomous Trucks Should Help Drivers</h2>

<p>Long before robots take over all the driving duties, autonomous technology will actually assist human drivers. Systems for collision avoidance, stability control and lane departure warnings should make driving a big-rig safer and more efficient. Some experts see the truck driver of the future as being more like an airline pilot: he or she can let the truck’s system handle long stretches of highway driving, but must take over during pick-up, delivery and other, more complex situations.</p>

<h2>Trucking is a Vast Industry</h2>

<p>There are an estimated 3.5 million Class 8 trucks on American roads today—and over 5.7 million commercial drivers. There are more than 210,000 trucking companies, most of which are small fleets or owner-operators. American Trucking Associations (ATA) projects that freight tonnage will increase by 24% in 2022, meaning drivers are still very necessary to keeping the economy running smoothly.</p>

<p>In other words, even when the technology is available, it will take self-driving trucks many years to penetrate such a large, complex industry. Also, different types of trucking modes and freight may require different kinds of self-driving technology. Chris Spear, the ATA’s president who also serves on a DOT committee exploring self-driving technology, has said it will be 20 to 25 years before fully autonomous commercial trucks are widely used.</p>

<p>“I think you’re always going to need drivers in the trucks in the cityscapes, doing pick-ups (and) deliveries,” Spear told a committee of lawmakers on Capitol Hill in late 2016.</p>

813,0,Blog Posts,Complete Guide to Choosing a Factoring Company,Complete Guide to Choosing a Factoring Company,"<p>Here’s what to do when choosing a factoring company.</p>

<h2>Ask the Important Questions</h2>

<p><strong>What are your terms? </strong></p>

<p>As a customer, you want as much flexibility in a factoring agreement as possible. A long-term contract with a <a href=""/product/factoring-services"">factoring company can be desirable</a> if it includes a price break or flexible rates. Many factoring companies will adjust their rates based on increased factoring volume or competitive offers from other factors. The industry standard for most factoring agreements is a one-year contract. With most factors, that contract will automatically renew unless you give the company a 60- or 90-day notice.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – you want a company that can answer all your questions. Ask the factoring company what their contract renewal process looks like, so you know what to expect.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What fees do you charge? Are there any “hidden” fees? </strong></p>

<p>This can vary depending on your industry and the factoring company involved. Some factors only charge a flat factoring fee, which is a percentage of the total invoice value. Other factors charge additional fees that cover money transfers, software, collateral and other costs of doing business. Make sure the factoring company you work with is upfront and transparent with you <a href=""/articles/how-much-does-invoice-factoring-cost"">about its fees</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – a factoring company that charges minimum-volume fees or has other hidden fees. These are fees that a factoring company charges when a customer doesn’t factor a certain amount in a given month, as outlined in your factoring agreement.</li>
	<li>Other fees to ask about: hidden, minimum-volume, invoice uploading/processing, quick pay, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Do you offer both recourse and non-recourse factoring? </strong></p>

<p>Recourse factoring means that you are ultimately responsible if the factor cannot collect on your customer invoices. A good factor will make every effort to collect payment before sending the invoice back to you. And they shouldn’t ask for a lump sum up front. Instead, they may take a portion of future cash advances or reserve payments to repay the invoice total.</p>

<p>With non-recourse factoring, the factoring company assumes more of the credit risk for the collection of the invoice. Typically, though, non-recourse is only applicable to a customer’s client who files bankruptcy within a set amount of time from when the invoice was sent.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – a factoring company that isn’t upfront about what <a href=""/articles/why-non-recourse-factoring-isnt-always-right-decision"">non-recourse factoring really means</a>. Although it may be to your advantage to find a factor that offers both recourse and non-recourse factoring, a factoring company that has a strong credit team can help ensure that you are working with good customers. This relieves some of the pressure of “being on the hook” for bad debt.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/difference-between-recourse-and-non-recourse-factoring"">Read more about recourse vs non-recourse factoring</a></p>

<p><strong>When do you file the UCC? </strong></p>

<p>Some factoring companies will file a <a href=""/articles/what-ucc-filing-important-info-trucking-companies"">Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)</a> for prospective customers as soon as they apply. Others wait to file until they receive a signed factoring agreement. A UCC lien allows the factor to claim what a company claims as collateral. It’s a required step that’s important to secure financing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – A factor that files the UCC as soon as you submit an application. If a factoring company files the UCC early and you decide to do business with another factor, the existing UCC must first be terminated. If you are shopping around for factoring companies, you want to make sure you know when the UCC is filed by each company, so you aren’t blindsided in the final stages of a deal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Do you have the capital to grow with me? </strong></p>

<p>As your company grows, the funding of invoices should grow with you. Find out as much information as you can about a factoring company’s capital structure and client base. What’s the factoring volume of their largest client? What is a typical account size? Is there a limit to how many debtors the factoring company can take on? Factoring companies that have been in business and have served your industry for several years usually have greater capacity to finance your company as it grows.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – newer factoring companies that might not have the resources to fund your invoices as you grow and take on more customers of your own.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What kind of technology do you have? </strong></p>

<p>Some factoring companies make it difficult for you to see your account information. Make sure you can access your account balance, aging and reserve reports online. This is critical information you need to run your business effectively. Also ask how invoices are submitted. Look for a company that offers a mobile solution, so you (and/or your drivers) can submit invoices from anywhere at any time.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – a factoring company that requires you to email or mail in invoice documents. This might mean they are lacking the technology that makes the entire factoring process much easier on you.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What’s the application process? </strong></p>

<p>Factoring companies do have some criteria in selecting new clients. Make sure the factoring company explains to you their process for approving you as a client. Is it your personal credit score? Is it the credit ratings and payment histories of your customers? Often, your company wants to factor because it needs a quick injection of cash flow. Make sure the factoring company is clear with you on how many days it will take to review and process your application.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for – companies that take a long time to approve your application. If it takes this long to get their customers started, will you run into similar issues with funding your invoices in a timely manner?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research the Company's Reputation</h2>

<p>The first place most people turn when researching new companies or services is Google. Since exemplary customer service should be an important part of your factoring experience, be sure to read the reviews for companies you’re considering. Are other current customers satisfied? Are there other things the company does that were part of a good or bad customer experience (think great or subpar customer service, or surprise additional fees)?</p>

<h2>Find Out What Other Services They Offer</h2>

<p>What makes the factoring fees worth it goes beyond the influx of cash into your account. Having the added back-office support to handle the billing and collections is another huge benefit. Look for companies that also offer additional services such as free credit checks on companies in your industry (e.g. brokers, shippers), access to a fuel card program, technology (e.g. a mobile app, integrated trucking software) and more. Find a factor that gives you what you need to help your company grow and make good business decisions. Remember, when choosing a factoring company, a little research can go a long way toward ensuring your factoring arrangement best serves both you and your customers.</p>

830,830,Blog Posts,How Much Does Invoice Factoring Cost?,How Much Does Invoice Factoring Cost?,"<p>When <a href=""/product/factoring-services"">partnering with a factoring company</a>, you are entering into a mutually beneficial relationship intended to create success for both parties. You sell your invoices to receive dependable cash quickly and the factoring company charges a per-invoice factoring fee called the factoring rate. As the primary cost to factoring, you should fully understand what a factoring rate is and how it’s determined.</p>

<h2><strong>What Determines A Factoring Rate</strong></h2>

<p>Generally speaking, a factoring fee structure is influenced by the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Industry</strong> – when setting factoring rates, certain industries (like trucking and transportation) provide a more reliable and high-volume stream of billable invoices. Because of this, factoring rates for trucking companies may be relatively lower when compared to other industries, such as textiles or staffing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Volume</strong> – When determining your rate, a factoring company will likely ask how much you plan to factor per month. Typically, the more you factor, the lower your rate is. You may even get set up with a <a href=""/articles/difference-between-tiered-and-flat-factoring-rates"">tiered plan for rates</a> depending on your anticipated growth. This means that as you increase your monthly volume, your factoring rates automatically decrease.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Risk</strong> – Increased possibility of risk is usually offset by a comparatively higher rate. For example, within factoring, there are two primary types of agreements – recourse and non-recourse. Non-recourse is when the factoring company takes on more risk of non-payment. As such, non-recourse inevitably comes with a higher factoring rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The diversity of your customer portfolio is also considered when calculating risk. It’s often less risky for a factoring company to buy several small invoices from multiple customers than buying a couple of very large invoices from a business with only two customers. You’ll get a lower rate with a more diverse book of customers, especially if most of them have good credit.</p>

<p>Each of these factors can be broken down into more specific details which will impact your overall factoring rate. Additional things that might be considered by some companies are your credit score (as the business owner), how long you’ve been in business and your annual revenue.</p>

<h2><strong>Are There Different Types of Factoring Rates?</strong></h2>

<p>There are two main types of factoring rates: flat rates and tiered rates. A flat factoring rate means the percentage you pay on each factored invoice is always the same. You know exactly what you’re paying in exchange for the advance on your invoice, regardless of how quickly or slowly your customers pay the factoring company. A tiered factoring rate means the percentage you pay on each factored invoice is a variable amount, depending on how quickly your customers pay the invoice. Your rate will be lower for customers who pay more quickly and higher for customers who take longer to pay. </p>

<p>A less commonly used rate structure is called prime plus. Prime plus means the factoring rate is made up of the interest the banks charge the factoring company plus extra. For example, if you have a rate of 3.5% plus prime, and the prime rate charged by the banks is 2%, you can expect to pay 5.5% on every invoice.</p>

<p>You may also hear about tiered rates as they relate to factoring volume, as mentioned above. Some factoring companies will lower your flat rate as you increase the total amount factored per month. For example, if you factor $100,000 per month, you may get a rate of 3%, but as you increase monthly volume to $200,000 the rate drops to 2.5%, $300,000 the rate drops to 2.0%, etc.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a Typical Factoring Rate?</strong></h2>

<p>Factoring rates for trucking companies typically fall between 1% and 5%. Again, these rates will vary depending on things like the industry, the volume, how many and what types of customers you have, etc.</p>

<h2><strong>What About Additional Fees?</strong></h2>

<p>A factoring company may charge additional fees outside of your factoring rate for things like invoice-processing, ACH or wire transfer, startup, maintenance, etc. While some companies will roll all these anticipated costs into a slightly higher factoring rate, others will charge on a case-by-case basis. The extra fees aren’t necessarily bad, as long as the factoring company is up front about them and you know what to expect. What you’ll need to watch out for are ‘hidden’ fees – anything you get charged for that wasn’t or isn’t openly discussed when asked.</p>

831,0,Blog Posts,10 Ways to Survive a Slow Trucking Market,10 Ways to Survive a Slow Trucking Market,"<p>In 2018, trucking was a good place to be. An increase in shipping demand, combined with a shortage of trucking capacity, helped boost load rates and drive more revenue for most carriers. Fuel costs were relatively low, e-commerce was up and taxes were down.</p>

<p>The trucking industry slowed down though in 2019. After a rush to fill capacity, there were more trucks and equipment available, fuel was still cheap and load rates took a hit. The trade dispute between the U.S. and China caused uncertainty, resulting in increased tension. And there were more than twice the number of bankruptcies declared in trucking, year-over-year from 2018.</p>

<p>Business might be slow right now for your trucking company, forcing you to make some tough decisions. But that doesn’t mean you should panic. Fortunately, there are many tactics you can implement to get through the tough times and prepare for a friendlier market. Here are ten strategies to consider – Some may sound familiar, but others might offer you a new perspective on how to survive a slow trucking market.</p>

<h2><strong>Devise a Backup Plan</strong></h2>

<p>Veteran fleet owners and independent owner-operators who have lived through a few cycles in the trucking business know that the good times do not last forever. To protect your company and your employees, you need a Plan B that you can put into action during the lean times. What kind of work can your people and equipment do when rates and traffic are down in the lanes you usually run?</p>

<p>In coming up with an effective backup plan, you need to pay careful attention to the market. What areas of the country are seeing better growth and freight movement? Could your fleet benefit from serving different shippers and population centers that have higher demand? If you lease most of your fleet’s equipment, would now be a good time to shift into a different trucking mode that is moving more tonnage at better rates?</p>

<p>While much of the trucking industry is experiencing a slowdown, there are still good opportunities. Transportation and warehousing together are still set to grow modestly, as projected, for the year. Updated infrastructure and new technologies are offering opportunities to bring in greater efficiencies, so that in some areas of logistics more work can be done in less time.</p>

<p>Can your fleet play a role in one of these expanding areas of the market? While times are tough right now, this might present a chance to retool your fleet while putting your drivers and power units to work.</p>

<h2><strong>Find New Income Opportunities</strong></h2>

<p>Using your connections and familiarity with the trucking business can help you generate some cash on the side. One way of doing this is by becoming an agent for RTS Financial. When you refer a friend or a business contact to RTS Financial’s factoring services, you receive a commission each month for as long as your referral remains an RTS Financial client. It is an easy way to generate steady income with minimal effort. To learn more about this opportunity, visit our <u><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/page/agent-program"">Agent Program</a></u> page.</p>

<h2><strong>Analyze Your Cash Flow</strong></h2>

<p>As always, you need to know how much money moves through your company and if that cash flow is going to be enough to sustain it. While this can be easier said than done, it’s important to think about the future.</p>

<p>Do you have any money left over after paying your bills and one-time expenses? If your company is not yet profitable, you need to know your break-even point. Breaking even is when revenue equals all of your fixed and variable costs. You’ll need to determine a profit margin that funds your company while also allowing you to put some money away to get through the lean times. For more information about financial statements and cash flow, read <u><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/basic-accounting-trucking-companies"">our guide</a></u>.</p>

<h2><strong>Set Realistic Revenue Goals</strong></h2>

<p>One mistake some trucking fleets made several years ago, and again in 2018, was trying to grow too fast. Today, some of those businesses have cut jobs or closed their doors.</p>

<p>If your company is still new to trucking, study your market and develop some revenue goals that are ambitious but achievable. Have a plan for how you will handle that growth through available cash, headcount and assets. Likewise, plan to have some cash on hand for when new business opportunity slows down. Growth is good, but it can initially drain cash and other assets. Additionally, if you don’t already, you should look into factoring services that will build your cash flow and help you through your growth plans.</p>

<h2><strong>Stay Liquid</strong></h2>

<p>When times are good, it is tempting to pump all of your profits into buying new equipment and adding headcount to your company. A potentially smarter play is to put a portion of that money into investments that can be liquidated when your company needs the cash. Work with a certified public accountant (CPA) or a financial planner to build a portfolio of stocks, bonds and mutual funds where your money will grow until you need it. Another approach is to invest some earnings into real estate, though it is not as liquid as the stock market. Volatility in the real estate market might mean you have to cash out when your holdings have lost some of their value.</p>

<h2><strong>Reduce Costs</strong></h2>

<p>Now is a good time to explore areas where you can cut spending without damaging your business. Take a critical eye to fixed costs like office space, payroll, equipment agreements and service providers. Can you lease less-expensive office space? Can you outsource some of your back-office functions to companies that specialize in that work? Even something as simple as switching telecom providers can potentially save your company hundreds of dollars per month. These numbers can add up over the course of a year or more.</p>

<p>Consider doing away with anything that is not essential to your business, such as the copier that can be replaced with a more modern solution. For contracts that are up for renewal, try renegotiating terms that are more favorable.</p>

<h2><strong>Know When You Need Financing</strong></h2>

<p>The right time to seek outside funding is before the point when your company desperately needs it. Avoid the mistake that many business owners make by waiting too long to get financing.</p>

<p>Understanding your company’s strengths and weaknesses, your available cash flow and your market are essential. Do you need capital to survive a downturn or to purchase equipment and trucks? Different stages in your company’s life can call for different forms of financing. Factoring, or accounts receivable financing, may be a good fit because you incur no debt and there are no limits to the amount of funding.</p>

<p>At other times, you may be willing to take on debt to fuel your company’s growth. It is important to plan your debt so that it follows the life of the asset it is financing. For example, taking out a five-year loan for equipment that fully depreciates in three years is a bad financing strategy.</p>

<h2><strong>Stay Informed</strong></h2>

<p>Although a less tactile strategy, it’s nonetheless more important than ever to stay informed on industry news. This is especially crucial at a time when things like the U.S.-China trade dispute are ongoing and unresolved. Keeping up with RTS helps, as we’ll always be monitoring the industry with your needs in mind. A daily or weekly check-in with trusted news sources can also help you plan in both the short and long terms.</p>

<h2><strong>Manage Risks</strong></h2>

<p>Calculate the benefits of financing for your company (growth, sustainability) against the risks (debt, default). Can your company afford to take on debt? How much should you borrow? Are you comfortable putting property or equipment up as collateral? Could your company survive if you default? Explore all your financing options, from factoring and alternative lenders to banks, to find the right fit.</p>

<p>Also, take a strategic approach to managing your assets. Does your company really need brand new trucks and equipment to operate effectively? New equipment often requires big down payments and interest that can eat up your cash flow. Equipment lease agreements are more flexible and require less working capital.</p>

<h2><strong>Seek Advice from Reliable Partners</strong></h2>

<p>Building a first-rate company that endures ups and downs in the trucking market will require some outside expertise. You need to assemble a team of advisors who know your industry and have more than just a monetary interest in your company’s growth. This team can include bankers, CPAs, financial planners, legal counsel and other lenders like a factoring company.</p>

<p>Not all of your advisors need to come from the legal or financial community. You can benefit from friendships with other fleet owners who are veterans of the industry. Seek out mentors and consider forming an advisory board of entrepreneurs. You might need some outside help in building a business that will last in the challenging trucking industry.</p>

That includes making sure that the latest and greatest fuel card you might be compelled to try will truly help your bottom line.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Determine If A Fuel Card Is Right for You</strong></h2>

<p>At the end of the day, you simply want to be paying less per gallon. With all the fuel cards currently on the market, it might take some unraveling of the discount structure before you can fully determine which one you’re actually going to save the most with. Consider the following questions when <a href=""/product/fuel-discount-program"">shopping around for a fuel card</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is the discount offered off the cash price or the credit price?</li>
	<li>Is it retail-minus, cost-plus or both?</li>
	<li>Are discounts given at the pump or as a rebate check?</li>
	<li>Are there any fees for using the card?</li>
	<li>How extensive is the network of stations where discounts are offered?</li>
	<li>Are there additional benefits offered by the fuel card program?</li>
</ul>

<div class=""btn btn-cta blue-solid"">
  <a href=""/page/contact-us"">Learn More About Our Fuel Card</a>
</div>

<h2><strong>Are Discounts Off the Cash or Credit Price?</strong></h2>

<p>Savings off the credit price may not be as great a deal as you think, especially when compared to getting discounts off the cash price. The cash price is less expensive than the credit price. This is because when a fuel station charges more for credit fuel purchases (less for cash), they are trying to offset the processing fees they are being charged by credit card companies.</p>

<p>Getting discounts off the cash price means getting additional money off the cheapest listed price. Whereas discounts off the credit price may end up still being more expensive than or possibly equaling the cash price. A detail like this could be hidden in the fine print of a card agreement, so make sure to ask.</p>

<h2><strong>Is the Card Retail Minus or Cost Plus?</strong></h2>

<p>Retail-minus pricing means you pay the prices advertised and receive a rebate through your fuel card provider. That price includes the cost of the fuel, taxes and a retail margin covering all expenses of doing business. The “minus” is the negotiated rebate your fuel card provider pays you as a rebate later.</p>

<p>With cost-plus, you don’t pay a fixed retail price. Rather, the driver pays a rack price based on the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) nationwide index, which varies, plus state and federal taxes. The “plus” is the addition of other fees.</p>

<p>Which model saves more money depends on retail margins and where you fuel up. In places like California or Hawaii where the cost of transporting fuel to retailers is more expensive, cost-plus usually saves more money. In areas like the Gulf Coast where fuel is cheaper and the margins thinner, retail-minus is usually the better option.</p>

<p>Some fuel cards offer a “better of” option. With each fuel purchase, the card will automatically calculate which of the two pricing models provides the most savings, so you get the best available discount on every transaction. That way, fleets and drivers do not have to worry about switching back and forth between retail-minus and cost-plus.</p>

<h2><strong>Are Discounts Given at the Pump or As a Rebate?</strong></h2>

<p>Some fuel cards provide point-of-sale discounts, meaning the cost of fuel is reduced at the point of settlement (right at the pump). Other fuel card programs offer a rebate model, meaning the full cost of fuel is billed to the driver at the pump and then the fleet receives a check at the end of the month for the total amount of money discounted from the fuel purchases. The rebate model can be confusing to drivers who see the full price on the receipt and think they’re not getting the discount.</p>

<h2><strong>Are There Any Fees for Using the Card?</strong></h2>

<p>Some fuel card companies charge a small, fixed transaction fee each time you use the card to purchase fuel. There may also be one-time setup fees, monthly fees or in/out-of-network fees. Ask about all of these when determining the true value of the fuel discounts. Most fees are minimal and won’t have much impact on your overall savings but it’s still good to know what to expect.</p>

<h2><strong>What Does the Network Look Like?</strong></h2>

<p>When looking at fuel cards, it’s important to consider the size and location of the fuel network covered by the program.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where do I get discounts? At large, nationwide fuel providers like Pilot Flying J or at independent, mom-and-pop shops? Are there multiple network options?</li>
	<li>Are the stations already along your route? Are the savings worth having to go out of your way at all to find them?</li>
	<li>Does the network cover the lanes you currently run as well as the lanes you want to run?</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Are There Additional Benefits to the Program?</strong></h2>

<p>There are other benefits to a fuel card program that should be considered, such as contract flexibility, fee waivers (or non-existent fees), scaled savings (the more gallons you purchase, the higher the discount) and discounts on other services or products you can actually use. Some fuel card programs compliment a station’s rewards program with extra points for certain purchases (e.g. 3x myRewards points on fuel at PFJ). Others offer additional discounts on lodging, document scanning, office supplies, etc. At the end of the day, you want to make sure that your fuel card is working for you in as many ways as possible.</p>

<p>A simple Google search generates several fuel card options, some of which will make attractive claims with deceptive discount amounts. Asking the right questions will help you find your answers and hopefully the best fuel card for your needs.</p>

834,0,Blog Posts,Why Non-Recourse Factoring Isn't Always the Right Decision,Why Non-Recourse Factoring Isn't Always the Right Decision,"<p>When choosing to factor your invoices, there are two primary types of factoring to consider: recourse and non-recourse. Recourse means that you’re ultimately responsible for the payment of an invoice if your customer doesn’t pay. Non-recourse means the factoring company is primarily responsible for collecting on unpaid invoices. It seems simple, but the protection that non-recourse factoring affords often comes with stipulations.</p>

<p>Here are the considerations a business needs to understand before choosing non-recourse.</p>

<h2><strong>There Shouldn’t Be Recourses to Begin With</strong></h2>

<p>A recourse on an invoice means the factoring company requires you, the customer, to buy back the unpaid invoice. If you are working with the right factoring company, though, you shouldn’t have any recourses. Recourses typically happen for a few main reasons: there are issues with the load, there is a service failure or there is missing paperwork. A reputable factoring company will help underwrite the credit risk and will make sure you get paid if you’re working with the right brokers. They may still offer non-recourse options, though, to ensure you get paid in certain circumstances, specifically bankruptcy.</p>

<h2><strong>Non-Recourse Factoring Isn’t Always What It Seems</strong></h2>

<p>With non-recourse factoring, you depend on your factoring company to collect debts even from a non-paying client. The catch is that there are specific circumstances that must be met before your invoice is truly eligible for non-recourse. A customer simply not paying their invoice isn’t grounds for completely absolving you of responsibility. Typically, the non-recourse arrangement only kicks in when a non-paying client files for bankruptcy during a specified amount of time after the invoice was sent. This leaves a lot of other non-payment situations completely off the table that you may not have realized aren’t covered.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because of the bankruptcy requirement, many factoring companies only offer non-recourse agreements that only apply to debtors with a good credit rating. This eliminates a lot of the risk of those debtors filing bankruptcy, which makes the non-recourse agreement unnecessary.</p>

<h2><strong>It’s Typically More Expensive</strong></h2>

<p>Non-recourse factoring agreements often come at a higher factoring rate (sometimes almost a full percentage point higher). Over time, this can end up costing you more money, especially if you don’t need or are not seeing the benefits you were expecting under such an agreement.</p>

<p>If you’re considering paying more for a non-recourse agreement, it’s important to fully understand what non-recourse actually means to your specific factoring company.</p>

1077,0,Blog Posts,New Entrant DOT Safety Audit for Trucking Companies,New Entrant DOT Safety Audit for Trucking Companies,"<p>Here’s what to look out for, some tips to make sure you pass, and other guidance surrounding this crucial aspect to your first 18 months in business.</p>

<h2>What Does the 18-Month New Entrant Safety Audit Involve?</h2>

<p>Audits typically happen onsite, at your primary location of business. There is an increased number of cases, however, where companies are asked to submit documentation for the audit online. If you are expected to enter your information online, you will receive an Offsite Safety Audit Letter from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) with instructions on how to login here: <a href=""https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/NewEntrant/login.aspx"">https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/NewEntrant/login.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>When you can expect the audit to take place gets a little confusing, initially. You’ll be audited within the first year (12 months) of operation, although you’ll be monitored for safety for the full 18-month period of the audit. Roadside and/or other inspections fulfill the second portion of monitoring during your new entrant safety period.</p>

<p>If onsite, the audit will be performed by either a state or federal official, under the authority of the FMCSA. Sometimes an authorized local provincial official can conduct the audit as well. At the time of the visit, the official will review the safety measures that your business has in place from multiple perspectives. Generally, they will look at:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operations to ensure that the systems in place are safe</li>
	<li>Driver qualifications and duty statuses</li>
	<li>Vehicle maintenance records</li>
	<li>Alcohol and substance testing programs and policies</li>
	<li>Accident registers</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Can I Prepare for the 18-Month New Entrant Safety Audit?</h2>

<p>The first and best way to prepare is to ensure that you’re following all recommended safety protocols as a new trucking company. This will mean digging more deeply into the above list of categories. Guides, checklists and similar resources are available from third-party resources that can be helpful. Keep clear and consistent documentation of all programs, and immediately address any safety concerns that might arise. Perfection isn’t required to pass a safety audit, but a record of attention and responsibility if and when safety concerns arise, will need to be clearly shown.</p>

<h2>Automatic Failure of New Entrant Safety Audit</h2>

<p>There are a few ways to immediately and automatically fail your 18-month new entrant safety audit:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Alcohol and drug violations</li>
	<li>Driver violations</li>
	<li>Operations violations</li>
	<li>Repair and inspection violations</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, in most of these cases, a violation occurs when you either don’t have an adequate program in place, and/or don’t take immediate action to rectify a situation where a driver, vehicle, or procedure has become a threat to public safety (and/or the safety of your own people). Have your programs in place, implement them when necessary, and be sure to report all inspections and to have all approved paperwork on file and up to date when it comes to your operating procedures.</p>

<h2>What Happens If I Don’t Pass the New Entrant Safety Audit?</h2>

<p>If you fail your audit, either automatically or when you are visited by the auditor, you will first receive written documentation from the FMCSA detailing why you failed. Barring a severe violation (which would result in immediate suspension of your authority), you will instead be given an opportunity to correct the conditions that led to you failing the audit.</p>

<p>The next thing you will need to do is submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to the FMCSA by the date listed on the paperwork notifying you of failure. If you do not do this, you will lose your FMCSA registration outright. It may take up to 45 days to first receive notice that you have not passed the audit.</p>

<p>Assuming an on-time filing of your CAP, you then have 60 days to implement and prove the implementation of your plan. Following this, assuming compliance, you’ll pass the audit. If you do not follow your CAP or again fail to implement certain crucial safety protocols, you may be suspended indefinitely from authorized operation.</p>

<h2>What Happens When My Trucking Company Passes the Safety Audit?</h2>

<p>Once you pass your new entrant safety audit, your trucking company will be subject to another six months of monitoring via roadside and other inspections. Assuming things go well after this period, you will then be granted full and permanent operating authority. While you will not be subject to the same safety auditing moving forward as your first 18 months, your trucking company will still be subject to regular inspections, investigations when appropriate, and other stipulations as an operator under the Compliance, Safety, and Accountability (CSA) program, under the jurisdiction of the? FMCSA.</p>

1078,0,Blog Posts,What is a UCC Filing? Important Info for Trucking Companies,What is a UCC Filing? Important Info for Trucking Companies,"<p>In simple terms, a UCC Filing is a record of collateralized debt, filed publicly by a lender to your business. UCC stands for “Uniform Commercial Code.” Basically, the UCC itself is a list of laws by which separate state governments have agreed to a single definition of any one requirement included in the code. In trucking, companies often operate across state lines, so there needs to be a unified way to keep track of certain aspects of the legal and financial sides of your business, no matter where you are.</p>

<p>When you hear about UCC filings in trucking, they are probably UCC-1 liens. These are published records generated by your lender(s) (e.g. your factoring company) of debt you’ve incurred. Your business name and the assets you are putting up as collateral (in case your customers don’t pay their invoices) are listed in the records.</p>

<h2>Why Are UCC Filings Necessary?</h2>

<p>Legally, if there is an issue collecting payment on an invoice (whether from your customers or you, if the invoice is recoursed), UCC filings establish a record of what you owe and what collateral your lender has a right to repossess. On a longer-term basis, UCC filings also provide an indication of how many liens are out in respect to your company. This is an important point, because too many liens on your public record may affect your ability to get credit in the future.</p>

<h2>What Do I Have to Do?</h2>

<p>UCC filings are a normal part of engaging in a factoring agreement. The factoring company will file the UCC lien at some point during the process of getting you signed up. Be sure to get full clarity on the terms of any type of financial contract, though, before any  filings are made that name your business.</p>

<p>Also, try to stay on top of lenders with a published UCC filing on a debt you’ve paid off. When your agreements have been fulfilled, make sure that a UCC-3 Filing (different than the initial filing) is sent by your lender indicating that the agreement has been satisfied. The purpose of a UCC-3 Filing is to remove the lien from the public record. Many partnering financiers unfortunately just wait for UCC filings to expire (after five years), which can leave you with unnecessary filings on record. You don’t want a paid-off borrowing agreement to stop you from accessing capital you might need later for reinvestment and growth.</p>

<p>A quick search on the state department web site where your company is located or headquartered (use terms like “UCC Filing” and/or the name of your business) can be an easy way to review expired agreements that need to be removed from public record.</p>

<p>Finally, you want to avoid a large number of UCC filings (liens) stacking up against your business, which could be a red flag to not only future lenders, but other business partners.</p>

<h2>Are There Different Types of UCC Filings?</h2>

<p>Yes. The two most common types of UCC Filings related to trucking include an All-Asset UCC Filing (or blanket lien) and a Collateral Specific UCC Filing. Whenever possible, seek a Collateral Specific UCC Filing in your dealings with lenders (for instance, if you’re borrowing specifically to pay for a truck, or if you’re only borrowing against invoices). Certain -- but definitely not all -- personal assets are protected by law as it relates to business debt, so be thoughtful around blanket liens.</p>

<h2>How Does This Affect Factoring Agreements?</h2>

<p>It is typical for a factoring company to file a UCC lien publicly illustrating your agreement and collateral arrangement (aka, reporting their secured interest in the accounts receivable you have sold to them). If you are shopping around for factoring companies, it’s important to know if/when any given company normally files the lien. Some factoring companies will file when you are still in the application stage of a prospective agreement. Should you decide later not to sign up with that company, the filing will have to be terminated before you can enter into an agreement with another company. This can cause unwelcome delays and surprises you were not unexpecting.</p>

1079,0,Blog Posts,What to Expect with a DOT Brake Inspection,What to Expect with a DOT Brake Inspection,"<p>The best-case scenario surrounding a roadside brake inspection is for drivers and trucking companies to be prepared ahead of time. This way, the inspection can proceed in a timely manner, follow all safety protocols and result in drivers being cleared to get back on the road. Here’s what to expect with a brake inspection.</p>

<h2>Do I Really Need to Worry About This?</h2>

<p>Yes! Aside from the aforementioned public safety and business continuity reasons, a truck sidelined by a failed brake inspection will affect your Compliance and Safety Accountability (CSA) score, as tallied and monitored by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). This score is used to measure high-risk carriers and drivers and could cause trouble for a driver and/or a trucking company if it gets too high.</p>

<h2>What Does a Brake Inspection Include?</h2>

<p>Roadside inspectors will check:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Air pressure (and the existence and operation of your low-pressure warning light)</li>
	<li>Brake adjustment</li>
	<li>Anti-lock brake warning light and system operation</li>
	<li>Air loss rate</li>
	<li>All hardware and tubing</li>
	<li>Linings and drums</li>
</ul>

<p>They will verify that all of the above listed items are in operation and there is no cause for concern. As always, drivers undergoing inspection should also have their license, authority number and registration on hand to show the inspector.</p>

<h2>Can I Do Anything Else to Prepare?</h2>

<p>Your first way to prepare should be a preventative maintenance (PM) program. While having a specific program like this might be more common in a larger trucking company, even smaller fleets or owner-operators can secure checklists from third parties to incorporate into their everyday maintenance work. They can also create and/or follow their own internal guidelines to ensure brake safety and compliance in preparation for continued safe operations and periodic inspections.</p>

<p>Additionally, drivers should always do their own brake inspections prior to each trip. This process should be part of the routine pre-trip inspection enforced collaboratively by maintenance and/or management.</p>

1080,0,Blog Posts,Financing Options for Trucking Companies,Financing Options for Trucking Companies,"<p>To help you start your research, we’ve put together this information about multiple financing options for trucking companies. However we do recommend that you do additional research, ask questions of any potential partners and make sure you fully understand the terms, payback structure and full cost of borrowing before making any financial decision that will impact your business.</p>

<h2>A Common Option: Loans</h2>

<p>A very common option for any financing needs is a commercial loan. Did you know there are several different types of loans though – based on size, type of business, etc.? And not all types of loans (or lenders) are created equal.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment Loans</strong><br />
These are specific to equipment, such as a truck. Rates and term length can and will vary based on your creditworthiness, but the equipment purchased with the loan does serve as its own collateral.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: Watch out for fees attached to an agreement that could add up. And be prepared to make a down payment. Even if you’re approved for 100% financing, making a down payment (if you’re able) will make repayment easier.</li>
	<li>How to apply: This varies. You can take an equipment loan out through a bank, a financial institution that specializes in equipment loans, or sometimes even through the manufacturer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Small Business Association (SBA) Loans</h3>

<p>SBA loans can sometimes be microloans in smaller amounts (e.g. $10,000) or very large loans in the millions. One advantage of an SBA loan is that the government acts as a partial guarantor. This makes it easier for banks to lend money to smaller businesses that are working on building their credit scores or don’t have an established business record yet.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: SBA loans tend to be fairly straightforward as far as terms, but the application process can be lengthy.</li>
	<li>How to apply: With an SBA loan, you’ll have to fill out paperwork with the government AND your selected lender (for instance, a bank). This can be time-consuming and may be accompanied by some back-and-forth between parties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Short-Term Business Loans</h3>

<p>Short-term loans are most commonly used for quick money in an emergency, and/or when other options aren’t available. They are usually expensive, so do a careful ROI analysis before taking one out. If you need money immediately to keep business moving, it may be a good option. And a shorter payback period does get the loan off your books faster.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: A short-term loan is often a costly option for financing, with high interest rates, fees that can add up and a required personal guarantee or lien on the equipment.</li>
	<li>How to apply: You’ll need to research lenders to try to get the best terms possible. Ask questions, do the math and consider all options before taking on a potentially expensive loan.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medium-Term Business Loans</h3>

<p>Medium-term business loans are similar to short-term loans, with a slightly longer payback period (e.g. five years as opposed to one). You get more time to pay, but that also means you’ll be paying interest over a longer period of time.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: A newer trucking company or one with a lower credit score will likely get hit with higher interest rates. Also, you may be asked for collateral, a personal guarantee, or to agree to a lien.</li>
	<li>How to apply: Banks or other financial institutions offer medium-term loans, but your eligibility may be impacted by the age and credit rating of your business. Another source you can research is an alternative lender, including newer web-based companies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term Business Loans</h3>

<p>Although structured similarly to short- and medium-term loans, long-term business loans are usually only a good idea for well-established and thriving companies with several years of strong results behind them. If you’re looking to grow without external investment, long-term loans can be an option for purchasing new equipment or other similar expenses. These types of loans can last for several years, and even up to a decade. Make sure that you’re comfortable with that type of repayment commitment when weighing your options.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: Keep an eye on terms as you normally would, and weigh the administrative ease of a single long-term loan against shorter-term options that can be just as viable, but with more flexibility year-to-year.</li>
	<li>How to apply: You can apply for a long-term loan through a bank, financial institution, or alternative lender. Some small business loans can serve as long-term loans.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Business Lines of Credit</h3>

<p>A business line of credit is similar to a business credit card in that you apply and then receive an established number that you are eligible to borrow, whether from a bank or alternative lender. Each time you need money, you borrow only what you need against this total line of credit from your lender. As such, you’ll also only pay interest on the total amount borrowed. Terms vary, but generally with a business line of credit, you’ll be required to pay down your balance more quickly than with other loan options.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: As with a credit card, capital from a line of credit can be easy to request and quick to add up.</li>
	<li>How to apply: Through a bank, other financial institution, or an alternative lender</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cards</h2>

<h3>Business Credit Cards</h3>

<p>The only real established benefit to a business credit card is its immediate availability in times of emergency. There are likely better options if you need to finance a large amount, so consider carefully before turning to this option. Cards are often a better fit for smaller and more regular purchases.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: Credit card interest and potential fees can add up quickly and a high credit card balance (in relation to your credit limit) has the potential to negatively impact your credit score.</li>
	<li>How to apply: Through an established bank or credit card company</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fuel Card</h3>

<p>There are also specialized types of cards to consider, such as a fuel card for fuel purchases. They may come with zero-interest credit lines that allow you to purchase fuel and repay with weekly or biweekly terms. The benefit of this type of card is that you can also get things like significant discounts on diesel fuel, rewards points from specific fuel providers, and additional discounts on maintenance and other services.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: Make sure the fuel card program you sign up for has a well-established network of stations along your routes. Look for fees that can add up, including transaction fees (in-network and out-of-network, monthly/annual fees, and application fees).</li>
	<li>How to apply: Through a fuel card program provider</li>
</ul>

<h2>Factoring</h2>

<p>Factoring is when you <a href=""/product/factoring-services"">sell your open invoices to a factoring company</a> instead of waiting 30 – 60 days for your customers to pay. A big plus to factoring is that it provides you with lump sum cash based on real invoices that your company has open and are due to be paid. Factoring can provide you with increased cash flow to invest in growth, perform maintenance or manage other operating expenses. Because factoring is tied directly to your actual sales, it reduces the risk to your business.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to look out for: When considering factoring, ask about the factoring rates, contractual obligation and any fees associated with the service.</li>
	<li>How to apply: Through a reputable factoring company</li>
</ul>

<h2>Merchant Cash Advances</h2>

<p>A Merchant Cash Advance (MCA), is another way to bring in borrowed capital, but it works differently than a loan or other options and should be considered with caution. An MCA is linked to projected future sales, usually based on recurring credit and debit card transactions you’ve shared with the provider of the potential advance. Determining the payback structure and calculating the total cost of an MCA can sometimes be confusing and depends on the provider, as MCAs are not closely regulated. Additionally, an MCA only works as an option if you have a transaction history to show the lender. MCAs can be a very expensive and volatile financing option. As with other forms of financing for your trucking company, make sure you <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/what-watch-out-merchant-cash-advances"">know what to watch out for</a> – get all the facts, compare terms and estimate your payback costs.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What to watch out for: High interest rates, outrageous fees, aggressive payback structure and loose regulations (meaning the borrower is provided with very little protection or legal recourse)</li>
	<li>How to apply: Through an MCA provider</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Causes of Cashflow Problems</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Long Pay Terms – </strong>In the trucking industry, pay terms are typically 30 – 60 days but can take as long as 90 days, leaving smaller companies struggling to pay overheard and operating expenses on time.</li>
	<li><strong>Overhead Expenses – </strong>Dispatch, accounts payable, accounts receivable, back-office tasks, etc. all add up.</li>
	<li><strong>General Operating Expenses – </strong>Truck service and maintenance can be unexpected and expensive, leaving companies to come up with money quickly. Then there’s planned expenses like fuel, driver and employee pay, insurance premiums and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Taxes – </strong>You’ll have annual taxes as well as IFTA, which is quarterly. If your tax bill is larger than anticipated, you may use all of your cash reserves and then some.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Primary Financial Options</h2>

<h3>Factoring</h3>

<p>Factoring is when a factoring company purchases your open invoices. You usually receive payment for those invoices within 24 hours. The factoring company then collects payment on those invoices from your customers. Factoring fees are determined as a percentage of an invoice value—usually between 1.5% and 3.5% for each receivable.</p>

<p>The main reason a company chooses to factor is to get paid on their invoices quickly, rather than waiting the 30, 60 or sometimes 90 days it often takes a customer to pay. How much a company factors will depend on their unique business needs. Some companies factor all their open invoices, while others factor only invoices for customers that traditionally take longer to pay. With factoring, companies get the increased cash flow they need to pay employees, handle customer orders, take on more business, etc.</p>

<h3>Asset-Based Lending (Bank Loans)</h3>

<p>Asset-based lending is a loan or a revolving line of credit that is secured using a company’s assets as collateral. Like factoring, asset-based lending can use receivables as collateral, but it can also extend to other assets like equipment, real estate, inventory and raw materials. Asset-based loans are priced with an annual percentage rate (APR), often ranging between 7% and 15%.</p>

<p>The amount of money a company can borrow through asset-based lending depends on the value of the assets that are offered as collateral. Asset-based loans provide a loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which can be between 75% and 90% for receivables, but often 50% or less on other collateral. If the value of your company’s assets changes, that will affect how much money you are able to borrow through an asset-based loan.</p>

<h3>How Do Bank Loans Compare to Factoring?</h3>

<p>The approval process for factoring generally involves reviewing the credit ratings of your company and your customers, which only takes a few days. To qualify for an asset-based loan, however, the value of the assets that will be used as collateral need to be verified. This can take the lender several days or even weeks.</p>

<p>Asset-based lending is typically more discreet. Before you enter into a factoring agreement, the factor must contact your customers to verify their accounts with your company. The factor will remain in contact with your customers since it will be handing collections on the invoices. There is usually little interaction between a bank and your customers, unless you are using your accounts receivable as collateral.</p>

<p>Finally, factoring is a sales transaction, not a loan. There are no required monthly payments to a lender. The factoring of invoices takes place with each sales transaction, which means that funding from factoring can “scale up” with your company’s growth as your receivables increase.</p>

<h3>Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)</h3>

<p>A merchant cash advance is a financial service where an MCA provider offers a cash advance based on your future sales. You pay back the advance plus interest in installments from an agreed-upon percentage of your daily credit card sales. Oftentimes, it’s between 10 – 20%. This means the daily dollar amount that is debited directly to the MCA provider will vary, depending on the total amount of your credit card receipts on a given day. Interest rates for MCAs are typically high so you may end up paying as much as 20 – 40% more than the amount advanced.</p>

<p>Merchant cash advances are most often used by companies that have a lot of credit card sales, such as retail stores and restaurants. It’s easier for a small business that may not have a great credit history to qualify for an MCA.</p>

<h3>How Do Merchant Cash Advances Compare to Factoring?</h3>

<p><a href=""/product/factoring-services"">Factoring provides access to cash</a> that has already been earned. A factor will only purchase invoices for your customers that have a decent credit rating. Once the factor purchases the invoice, your risk of customer nonpayment is drastically reduced. The factor gets paid through factoring fees collected from each invoice.</p>

<p>A merchant cash advance is funded from future sales. Once your application is approved, you’ll receive payment typically within two days. With no collateral and no personal guarantee required, the risk to the lender is high. This means the interest rates and fees may be high. The MCA provider gets paid a daily percentage of your sales through direct access to bank account, until the loan amount plus interest is paid in full. Penalties from MCA lenders for nonpayment are harsh and can often cause additional financial hardship.</p>

1087,0,Blog Posts,What Are DOT Driver Qualification Files?,What Are DOT Driver Qualification Files?,"<p>According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), under whose jurisdiction trucking companies function to remain legally operational, “all motor carriers must maintain a qualification file for each employed driver.”</p>

<p>Here are some basic facts to get you started.</p>

<h2>What is a Driver Qualification File</h2>

<p>Basically, a driver qualification file is a comprehensive file compiling the full historical employment, safety and certification history of each driver you employ. It’s required by the FMCSA to maintain operating authority. Even if you are an owner-operator (and thus the only employee of your company) you need to maintain a driver qualification file on yourself.</p>

<p>All driver qualification files for your trucking company need to be easily available if and when requested by an agent operating under the authority of the FMCSA, which itself operates under the authority of the Department of Transportation (DOT).</p>

<p>You need to maintain a driver qualification file for each year you employ a driver, and for three years following the end of their employment. When a driver has been with you for less than three years, you’ll need records from prior employers.</p>

<h2>Why Do I Need a Driver Qualification File?</h2>

<p>While the requirements of assembling and updating them may seem tedious, the purpose of driver qualification files is to illustrate and ensure the continued qualifications of your drivers to operate their trucks safely, regarding both driving and conduct. It is basically about keeping an official and updated record of any history of moving violations, drug and alcohol violations, or other incidents, including how they’ve been addressed. This is to ensure the continued safe conduct of your employees on and off the road. It also serves as verifiable proof that trainings have been conducted and certifications earned through due diligence.</p>

<h2>What Should be in a Driver Qualification File?</h2>

<p>Both new and established trucking companies need to maintain the following documents within each driver qualification file for every driver on payroll:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>An application of employment</strong><br />
	You can either use your own or a templated application provided by the FMCSA but must maintain a copy in each qualification file. If you use your own, make sure it follows the appropriate federal regulations for an employee application.<br />
	df</li>
	<li><strong>Employee’s current and prior Motor Vehicle Record (MVR)</strong><br />
	The most recent MVR should be from the state issuing his/her driver’s license, covering the previous twelve months. Going back, you need to also have MVRs for each driver for the previous three-year period, with no gaps, regardless of whether you were their employer or not during the given time. If the driver was licensed in more than one state, you’ll need an MVR for each state. If the driver has a CDL, there is an additional requirement to list all other employers the driver has worked for over the previous ten-year period.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Records of violations, safety performance, etc.</strong><br />
	Regardless of whether you employed the driver at the time of any violations, you must maintain official certified records of any moving vehicle, alcohol or controlled substances violations incurred by the driver, excluding parking violations. This may also include filing evidence of inquiries into records obtained, or violations that have occurred during employment with you and what official actions you took to address the violation(s). Additionally, you are required to maintain a historical record of safety performance for both the current year of employment and for the three previous calendar years.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Copies of licenses, training certificates, road tests, etc. </strong><br />
	This category is a bit simpler, and follows the common-sense practice of having copies on file of anything a driver needs to operate legally. If the driver has a CDL, maintain a current copy. You should also maintain copies of road tests and various certifications (e.g. Entry Level, Longer Combination Vehicle, etc.) that the driver has earned or has been required to maintain in any areas he or she might specifically need to do their job, above any baseline requirements.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>Medical report and certificate</strong><br />
	All drivers for your trucking company (again, even if the only driver is you) must be medically cleared to operate a motor vehicle. This certification needs to be updated every two years, and it must be conducted by a medical examiner recognized by the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a more detailed list of exactly what’s required in each category, you can review <a href=""https://csa.fmcsa.dot.gov/safetyplanner/documents/Forms/Driver%20Qualification%20Checklist_508.pdf"">this checklist</a> from the FMCSA.</p>

<p>Building and maintaining a driver qualification file takes time, but you’ll be glad you kept everything in order for when you need it (audits or other operating needs). Also, make sure to keep all your driver records secure!</p>

1091,1091,Blog Posts,Checking Freight Broker Credit Ratings ,Checking Freight Broker Credit Ratings ,"<p>Penalties have gotten steeper for freight brokerages that don’t treat carriers fairly, including paying them on time. But this has not completely deterred all brokers from poor behavior. While the potential for payment issues can pose a significant credit risk to carriers of any size,  smaller trucker companies need to be especially careful. With such small margins and high operating costs, missing even one payment from a broker can have serious consequences for the long-term success of their business.</p>

<p>Below are a few ways to find out important information about the brokers you plan to work with:</p>

<h2>Monitor Credit Through a Third Party</h2>

<p>Third-party credit reporting services can help you check the broker’s credit rating and days-to-pay information. For example, finding a system with an app that tracks and reports payment and credit information on thousands of freight brokerages can be a useful tool. This type of service can produce detailed credit reports designed exclusively for carriers. Avoiding freight brokers that pose a high credit risk is smart and these types of services help you make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>Search for Historical Information</h2>

<p>When you search the broker on the web, you’ll quickly find its MC number and DOT number. This information will enable you to identify the broker’s insurance carrier and to discover how long the brokerage has had an active authority. Another resource for this type of information is the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) website.</p>

<h2>Ask Questions</h2>

<p>Any good business relationship starts with asking the right questions. When vetting a broker and checking for risk, consider these specific questions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Does the freight broker have the required $75,000 bond?</li>
	<li>How long have they been in business?</li>
	<li>How are they going to pay you?</li>
	<li>Do they have references they’re willing to share?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trust Your Instincts</h2>

<p>This is perhaps an obvious tip, but it’s worth repeating. When business gets busy, it can be easy to forget that your instincts are your first defense against risk. How is the broker’s customer service? Do they answer the phone or respond promptly to outreach? Do they have a functional and user-friendly website? A broker that prioritizes customer service is much more likely to be a dependable partner.</p>

<p>Companies turn to factoring to help with cash flow for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: speed up invoicing, manage daily operations, gain access to capital for reinvestment into the business (or for expansion) or sometimes to simply reduce administrative burden in the short or long term. Factoring allows your company to sell you open invoices to the factoring company for same-day payment. The factoring company then takes over payment collection from your customers.</p>

<p>Factoring is also sometimes called accounts receivable financing. This term might be more helpful when you’re trying to determine if you company could benefit from factoring. Quite simply, do you sell products or services to another business on credit terms (net-30, net-60)? If so, your business is likely to be a good candidate for factoring.</p>

<h4>Here’s a short list of industries that regularly use factoring:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Trucking and freight companies</li>
	<li>Logistics</li>
	<li>Manufacturers</li>
	<li>Wholesalers</li>
	<li>Energy, oil and gas</li>
	<li>Advertisers</li>
	<li>Distributors</li>
	<li>Commercial food service</li>
	<li>Telecom</li>
	<li>Staffing</li>
	<li>Construction</li>
	<li>Textiles</li>
	<li>Aerospace</li>
	<li>Government suppliers</li>
	<li>Farming</li>

	<li>Janitorial and cleaning</li>
	<li>Call centers</li>
	<li>Security and investigative services</li>
	<li>Courier and delivery services</li>
</ul>

<p>If your business is in one of these industries and meets the general criteria discussed above, factoring might be a great option to consider to help you increase your cash flow.</p>

1190,0,Blog Posts,How to Get a Working Capital Loan with Bad Credit,How to Get a Working Capital Loan with Bad Credit,"<p>Even the most diligent business owner can run into a situation where they need capital to address an issue or time-sensitive opportunity. A low credit score can make finding a working capital loan a challenge. Here are some options to consider.  </p>

<h2>More Time</h2>

<p>Before taking on a high-interest working capital loan,  consider some immediate short-term, cost-saving options. These may allow you to free up capital now so that you can survive the short-term needs.</p>

<p>For example, you may consider asking vendors for a little extra time to pay or if you can pay invoices in increments (payment plan) for a specified time. Such a strategy should be thoughtfully presented to the vendor with details on how and when you will pay back the full amount.</p>

<h2>Factoring</h2>

<p>The great thing about using factoring to bring in capital is that funds are based on money that is already owed to you in the form of open invoices. Because of this, the credit score of your customers actually matters more than your own business credit score. Factoring companies front you the working capital you need and then handle the collections for you, taking a small percentage as the factoring fee. Rates vary, and different factoring companies have different parameters for such an arrangement, so ask questions to make sure this is the right fit for you.</p>

<h2>Merchant Cash Advance</h2>

<p>A merchant cash advance (MCA) is linked to future sales, based on past debit and credit card transactions. An MCA can provide a lump sum of short-term working capital quickly, but you will have to immediately begin paying it back. And if your business does not end up meeting the projections established when you applied for the MCA, you will still owe based on the real amount borrowed. This form of borrowing is mostly unregulated, which can result in higher interest rates, more fees and fewer protections for the borrower. MCAs are known to be a riskier borrowing option – <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/what-watch-out-merchant-cash-advances"">Find out why here</a>.</p>

<h2>Business Line of Credit</h2>

<p>A business line of credit usually comes from a more traditional financial institution (like your bank) that you have an established business relationship with. A line of credit is usually in the form of a business credit card. While this type of working capital loan can be an easy or quick option, you will likely pay higher interest.</p>

<h2>Asset-Based Loans</h2>

<p>Sometimes if a bank expresses concern over your credit score, they may still provide a working capital loan if you have collateral assets to borrow against that will guarantee your ability to pay. Assets include things like equipment, accounts receivable or real estate. Similarly, if you need working capital to keep up payroll but also need to replace equipment, an option may be to secure the equipment using a loan or payment plan, and then using the capital to cover your other expenses.</p>

<h2>Alternative Loans</h2>

<p>When your credit excludes you from receiving a working capital loan from more traditional sources, you may still be eligible to borrow from an alternative lender such as an online institution. You usually receive your loan much faster this way but run the risk of paying inflated interest rates.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for only a small amount of capital, you might also consider a microloan. These smaller loans usually consider your company’s track record over your credit score when approving your application.</p>

<p>If you find that you need working capital quickly, whether to replace equipment, cover payroll, or for a temporary setback, but your credit score isn’t the best, consider these options in the context of your specific circumstances. You want to make sure that quick money options don’t lead to serious issues when trying to pay them back. This could ruin your business and damage your credit score even further.</p>

1191,0,Blog Posts,What is Trucking Dispatch Software?,What is Trucking Dispatch Software?,"<p>Are you an owner-operator looking to build new efficiencies or grow your business? Or maybe a broker who needs to upgrade legacy systems to improve dispatch and keep up with today’s fast-paced, tech-enabled environment? Either way, if you’re in the trucking industry, you’ve probably at least heard about trucking dispatch software. Trucking dispatch software is technology that eases the stress and workflow for your dispatch team. Most programs will include a live dispatch board, shipment tracking with integrated GPS and scheduling capabilities.</p>

<h4>When deciding whether trucking dispatch software is right for you, there are some questions worth asking:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Why do I need dispatch software?</li>
	<li>How do I find software that’s right for me?</li>
	<li>What are the additional benefits to using trucking software?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Do I Need Dispatch Software?</h2>

<p>Trucking companies and owner-operators have been managing their side of supply chain logistics for a long time. Smaller companies tend to default to using spreadsheets and multiple programs, which may be a decent solution, but definitely has its drawbacks. Implementing trucking software can be a significant upgrade to your current system. Having all your dispatch information in one location can help introduce new efficiencies and backups that streamline operations and increase productivity.</p>

<h2>How Do I Find Software That’s Right for Me?</h2>

<p>There are many dispatch software systems to choose from, each with its own features. Check out our list of <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GDGEL9Og9bF73aLWMJR1cKgEGGmzME4jT7ZDmzzB9gA/edit?usp=sharing"">Top 10 Dispatch Software Systems for Transportation and Trucking</a>  for a quick and easy introduction to some of the most popular options.</p>

<p>While businesses may prefer one option over another, all these systems offer digitization and visualization. What used to be done over the phone and tracked with spreadsheets and basic accounting programs, can now be combined into one desktop, web-based or app-based system. It’s simpler, more convenient, reduces potential errors and leads to better reporting and more informed decision making.</p>

<h2>What Are the Additional Benefits to Using Trucking Software?</h2>

<p>By using trucking software to facilitate operations, you can more effectively monitor and improve results using data and integration. A key component of many dispatch software systems is the data they can provide that will help you quickly measure and analyze how your operations are performing. Integration capabilities also help to streamline your communications and reporting.</p>

<h4>Common features include:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Real-time reporting, available on demand through the software</li>
	<li>Analysis of planned vs. actual routes</li>
	<li>Streamlined communications with drivers and dispatchers</li>
	<li>Integrated invoicing options</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, each company owner has the final say on how to operate their business. But when you’re looking for a competitive edge, staying ahead of the competition and making more informed business decisions could be as easy as finding and implementing the right trucking dispatch software.</p>

1192,0,Blog Posts,What Is a DOT Safety Rating,What Is a DOT Safety Rating,"<h2>What is a DOT Safety Rating?</h2>

<p>A safety rating is a publicly accessible and up-to-date record of a driver or trucking company’s safe driving and conduct. It is evaluated by the FMCSA, operating under the DOT.</p>

<p>Trucking companies and drivers will receive one of three potential safety ratings: Satisfactory, Conditional or Unsatisfactory.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Satisfactory - Satisfactory is the best possible outcome when it comes to safety ratings. It means that your company or driver is in good shape and that you have adequately followed safety protocols.</li>
	<li>Conditional - When your trucking company has failed to follow some safety protocols, you may receive a Conditional safety rating. While you’ll still be permitted to operate with this rating, customers, creditors and insurers may see it as a warning sign. If you receive this rating, you’ll want to take immediate action to get it upgraded to Satisfactory.</li>
	<li>Unsatisfactory - An Unsatisfactory safety rating means that a driver or trucking company has failed to implement proper and compliant safety protocols. If you receive this rating, you will have 45 to 60 days to make the necessary safety improvements in order to continue operating.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Not documenting procedures can lower your safety rating. The first step toward upgrading your rating will be to address the issues presented by the FMCSA and formally request a new rating. See <a href=""https://csa.fmcsa.dot.gov/safetyplanner/MyFiles/SubSections.aspx?ch=20&sec=58&sub=104"">this page</a> for details on how to request a safety rating review.</p>

<h2>How Can I Learn My Current Rating?</h2>

<p>To learn your safety rating, visit <a href=""https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/CompanySnapshot.aspx"">https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/CompanySnapshot.aspx</a> and follow the prompts on the screen. This is an official database run by the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS), administered by the FMCSA.</p>

<h2>How to Keep Your Safety Rating Up</h2>

<p>Even with a Satisfactory rating, it’s important to maintain your safety protocols and procedures to avoid slipping into a lower safety rating category.</p>

<h4>Here are some steps to take and factors to consider to maintain your Satisfactory rating:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Maintain accurate and up-to-date records (driver logs, accidents, financials, maintenance, inspections, etc.)</li>
	<li>Maintain equipment and self-inspect regularly</li>
	<li>Continue to comply with FMCSA and DOT guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t already have one, a simple training program can be a great way to increase driver and employee compliance with your trucking company’s efforts to keep up a good safety rating. Invest time and resources now to avoid complications or losses in the future.</p>

1208,1208,Blog Posts,What to Know About the Annual DOT Inspection,What to Know About the Annual DOT Inspection,"<p>Every 12 months, commercial motor vehicles (CMV) weighing more than 10,000 pounds must undergo an inspection by the Department of Transportation (DOT). This inspection is to ensure that all parts are in safe and working order. Failure to pass inspection can lead to fines, audits and the suspension of your clearance to operate by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which operates under the jurisdiction of the DOT. Before you submit your annual DOT inspection, review the following information. Knowing what to expect can increase your likelihood of passing the inspection with minimal issues.</p>

<h2>Prepare Documentation</h2>

<p>The review of your required paperwork is just as important as the physical inspection of your vehicle. Be sure to have the necessary records required by the FMCSA, such as proof of insurance, accident registers, driver documentation (e.g., licenses, drug and alcohol test results, road tests, trainings) and more.</p>

<h2>Educate and Prepare Drivers and Employees </h2>

<p>You can help prepare your company for a DOT inspection by educating your drivers. Rather than chance certain elements of the inspection slipping through the cracks, take a proactive approach and implement an internal educational program. Regular, company-wide communication of requirements means that you won’t be dependent on a single individual to maintain the necessary compliance and safety protocols that you need to pass your annual DOT inspections.</p>

<h2>Maintain Vehicle and Records of Repair</h2>

<p>As expected, a major part of passing your annual DOT inspection will be maintaining the condition of your vehicles. To prove that you’ve kept up with maintenance on your trucks, you will have to provide records of repair. Be sure to keep in regular contact with mechanics throughout the year about the status of trucks, parts, equipment and major accessories. This includes making sure that all records of repair are available to inspectors, so they can quickly ensure that any needed repairs from previous inspections have been maintained and that you’ve done your due diligence.</p>

<h2>Use Checklists</h2>

<p>The best and most efficient way to ensure that you’re adequately prepared for your annual DOT inspection is to have an updated checklist system in place. Keep a list of everything needed to pass inspection each year, including all of the necessary reporting requirements. Know which requirements apply to you and make every effort to be over prepared rather than under prepared.</p>

<p>Although it can feel like a hassle when the deadline approaches, the annual DOT inspection is a necessary part of maintaining your legal authority. It also helps ensure that you are safely operating as a truck driver and/or fleet owner. Staying up-to-date on inspection requirements and changes to the FMCSA or DOT regulations is essential to maintaining a thriving and optimized business.</p>

1209,0,Blog Posts,How to Prepare for a DOT Physical,How to Prepare for a DOT Physical,"<p>In the simplest terms, you need to report to an approved medical professional, pass a physical exam and obtain your clearance under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The following tips may help you better prepare for the physical.</p>

<h2>Don't Stress Out About It</h2>

<p>It’s normal to worry about your DOT physical. However, the physical is just part of the process of gaining and keeping your approval to drive and worrying about it can do more harm than good. Short-term stress about the physical can actually throw off the results. Stress can elevate your blood pressure and cause additional anxiety. Try to make sure that you get good sleep the night before, leave yourself plenty of time to get to the exam and make every effort to create a stress-free environment as you get ready for the physical.</p>

<h2>Watch Your Diet Before the Exam</h2>

<p>Eating a big meal full of salt the night before a physical can affect your blood glucose levels and throw off blood pressure readings. Additional things to limit before your exam: tobacco use, caffeine intake and any other stimulants (like energy drinks) that may increase the risk of showing a high blood pressure reading during the physical. A healthier diet in the week leading up to your physical will go a long way toward helping you pass. Take it a step further and see if you can implement small dietary changes even earlier. Remember, small changes are easier to maintain and will help your body stay fit for the physical exam and the long haul.</p>

<h2>Take Prescribed Medications As Directed</h2>

<p>You don’t have to be in perfect health to pass your physical, but you also don’t want to fail the exam for something avoidable. Be sure to keep up with any prescribed medications and treatments. Failing to take medications as prescribed can trigger red flags in the examination room, leading to a failed physical.</p>

<h2>Have Your Paperwork Ready</h2>

<p>Bring any medical records you have available from your general medical practitioner to your DOT physical. You’ll want a record available for each current and past medical issue and steps you have taken or are taking to handle it. Having everything in order may help to avoid issues or delays with passing the physical. This includes a list of medications, names and contact info of other medical professionals you’ve seen and lab tests results. The more information you have with you when you show up, the better.</p>

<h2>Bring Glasses and Medical Devices</h2>

<p>If you wear glasses or contacts, make sure your prescriptions and lenses are up to date, and bring everything with you to your exam. If you have other medical devices that could be important to your medical history as it relates to driving (such as a CPAP machine for sleep apnea), bring these too. When in doubt, bring it out.</p>

<h2>Drink Water to Stay Hydrated</h2>

<p>Staying hydrated is always a good idea, but you should especially increase your water intake in the hours leading up to your physical. The added benefit - producing the urine sample will be that much easier.</p>

<h2>Know What Happens After the Exam</h2>

<p>At the end of your DOT physical, you’ll either be cleared to drive for two years, cleared to drive with more frequent monitoring or banned from operating due to health concerns. If you are banned from operating, know that you are entitled to a second opinion under the FMCSA. Taking all of the above steps can help you relax and to prepare as best you can.</p>

1210,0,Blog Posts,Invoicing and Collections for Trucking Companies,Invoicing and Collections for Trucking Companies,"<p>Cash flow can make or break a trucking company’s operations. Having a good cash flow means steadily bringing money in to be able to purchase fuel for the next load, pay your drivers on time and continue to pick up new business. Part of managing your cash flow is proper invoicing and collections. Your customers should be paying your invoices in full and on time, every time. If they’re not, it may be beneficial to take a look at your invoicing and collections process.</p>

<h2>Get all the information right the first time</h2>

<p>The first step to successful invoicing is to ensure that all relevant information appears on the invoice clearly and correctly. Incorrect information can delay payment and cause additional work for you or your back-office staff. In general, you’ll want to include at least the following information on your invoices:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your full, legal business name and official address</li>
	<li>The full, legal business name of the entity you’re billing, and their official address</li>
	<li>Contact information for each of the above (make sure it’s the correct contact specific to billing)</li>
	<li>Reference number(s) for the particular job(s) being billed</li>
	<li>Necessary additional paperwork (receipts, BOLs)</li>
	<li>Summary/description of work</li>
	<li>Date (mailed or emailed) and a due date for payment</li>
	<li>Cost breakdown(s), including applicable taxes and fees</li>
	<li>Total amount due</li>
	<li>Accepted methods of payment and instructions for paying the invoice</li>
	<li>Any additional information specific to your business</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create a Process for Sending Invoices </h2>

<p>Another key to successful invoicing is the process. You’ll want to develop and implement a documented system for creating, delivering and following up on your invoices. This can be a simple list, but it will help serve as a resource if collecting payment on the invoice becomes an issue. Determine who is responsible for what internally, including clear instructions on how and when to deliver invoices, and how and when to follow up with your customers.</p>

<h2>Communicate Clearly with Customers </h2>

<p>Sometimes invoices aren’t paid on time. There are a variety of reasons, from errors on the invoices themselves to issues or delays with your customers that are unrelated to your company (e.g., turnover, lost paperwork, etc.). The first (and nicest) thing to do when an invoice hasn’t been paid by the due date is to politely follow up.</p>

<p>If following up doesn’t work (and depending on the process and timeline you’ve created for following up on invoices), reach out again, explain that payment is past due and firmly request a quick resolution. Open communication is usually helpful so if needed, offer to have a conversation to go over the situation. If you are still unable to collect payment, you may need to consider a third-party collections agency to manage the debt.</p>

<h2>Consider Factoring Services</h2>

<p>Trucking companies who are looking to streamline and simplify invoicing and collections should consider partnering with a factoring company. In addition to increasing your cash flow by paying you for open invoices within 24 hours, the factoring company manages the invoicing and collections process for you. You can get paid the same day you submit an invoice and you don’t have to worry about collecting payment from your customer. The quick payment and additional back-office support usually offsets the minimal factoring fee you pay for services.</p>

<p>However you decide to facilitate the invoicing process for your company, having a plan in place and knowing the options available will make it easier to stay in control even if you run into collections issues.</p>

1262,0,Blog Posts,What Happens if You Fail a DOT Physical?,What Happens if You Fail a DOT Physical?,"<p>The DOT physical is a comprehensive health examination mandated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Required as a compliance measure, DOT physicals ensure that commercial drivers are healthy and fit to drive. If you’ve failed your DOT physical, it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. A failed test doesn’t mean it’s the end of the line for your driving career. Sometimes changing your DOT physical status from fail to pass is as simple as getting corrective lenses.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for moving forward after a failed DOT physical:</p>

<h2>Don’t Panic</h2>

<p>Panicking only creates additional and unnecessary stress, which is bad for your health. Focus on the facts, and don’t jump to extremes. Unless you have a diagnosed medical condition that can’t be treated, chances are you’ll have an opportunity to address the area(s) that led to your failure of the physical. For instance, if your eyesight posed an issue, corrective lenses could solve the problem immediately. Similarly, if hearing loss contributed to your failed test, the resolution may be as simple as a hearing aid.</p>

<h2>Determine What You Need to Do</h2>

<p>The doctor performing your DOT physical and/or checking your records for the appropriate results should be able to provide a clear explanation as to why you failed. Ask questions to make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem areas, and use this information to decide on your next steps. Make sure to ask your medical provider for clear recommendations on how to address the issues that led to your failed test so that you can pass it in the future.</p>

<h2>Get A Second Opinion </h2>

<p>You’re always entitled to a second opinion under FMCSA rules. Remember that you will need to provide the second examiner with the same records as the first, and you must provide him or her with all other relevant information to help them make their determination. Some drivers are tempted to withhold information in hopes of passing with a second provider, but it’s important to remember that each doctor you see is required to file a report with the FMCSA. It is better to be honest so you don’t get caught trying to cheat the system.</p>

<h2>Find Out If An Exception Is Appropriate</h2>

<p>The FMCSA does leave room for certain exceptions when it comes to receiving medical clearance to drive. These might include anything from hearing and vision issues that can be addressed through medical aids, to missing or limited limbs that don’t necessarily affect your ability to drive safely. If the issue can be adequately managed to ensure safety on the road, it may very well be possible to gain medical clearance despite the initial failure of your DOT physical.</p>

<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>

<p>While cause for concern, failing your DOT physical does not mean it's the end of the road for your career. Keep in mind, though, that the test is in place for your safety and the safety of others and you do have options to improve your outcome. Take good care of your health on a day-to-day basis, address any medical conditions necessary for you to maintain road-readiness and stay up to date on all DOT physical requirements.</p>

1263,0,Blog Posts,Finding and Using Fuel Taxes by State,Finding and Using Fuel Taxes by State,"<p>When you search for information on fuel taxes by state, the early results could seem intimidating. You might find busy, complex charts with rows and columns of small text that’s difficult to look at. Then, once you find the information you’re looking for, you have to figure out how to use it (e.g., fuel planning, IFTA, etc.).</p>

<p>So, how can you quickly and easily find the state fuel tax info you need and use it to make the best financial decision for your company? Find out below.</p>

<h2>Find a Good Resource</h2>

<p>There are resources available that have taken the data from the numerous charts and presented them in formats that give you the same state fuel tax information in a more direct, clear format. One in particular is <a href=""https://gasprices.aaa.com/"">AAA</a>. You can click on a map, sort by state using dropdowns, and fairly easily compare fuel taxes between states. Similar aggregated data can also be found on the website for the <a href=""https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/consumer-information/motor-fuel-taxes/gasoline-tax"">American Petroleum Institute (API) </a></p>

<h2>Figure Out IFTA</h2>

<p>State fuel taxes are factored into the cost per gallon when you purchase fuel. This way, you pay the state tax at the pump and then reconcile interstate usage later. When calculating IFTA, you determine the taxes that should be paid on fuel burned within each state, regardless of where the fuel was purchased. The total you already paid in state taxes at the time of the purchase is figured into the equation when you file IFTA quarterly. This may sound complicated, but IFTA actually simplifies the fuel tax process by allowing drivers to move more freely between states. All they have to do is keep their receipts for gallons purchased and track mileage; then leave the accounting for later. And with plenty of programs and resources available to calculate IFTA, all you have to do is input the data or link your fuel card to a system that will use the integrated data to calculate everything for you.</p>

<h2>Using Fuel Planning</h2>

<p>While IFTA does simplify and streamline fuel shopping, taxes do vary from state to state. When the time comes to reconcile and report your taxes for fuel purchase and consumption, you’ll still want to have done your best to minimize costs at the pump. As with so many other areas of trucking, taking advantage of fuel tax rates across state lines is about planning, staying informed and remaining flexible enough so that you maximize any potential savings. Seek out lower gas prices by comparing state taxes and do your best to balance price shopping with other goals of your operations.</p>

1264,0,Blog Posts,Equipment Financing for Trucking Companies,Equipment Financing for Trucking Companies,"<h2>Define Your Needs</h2>

<p>It’s important to realize that the needs of each driver or business will be different. You should first figure out what you need or want before doing too much research on which financing options are available and the terms of those options. Ask yourself questions like these:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What kind(s) of trucks do you need or want for your business?</li>
	<li>Are you looking for a single truck or more than one?</li>
	<li>Do you need to buy new, or can you lease?</li>
	<li>What are the market prices for new and used versions of what you need?</li>
	<li>If you’re deciding whether to lease or buy, would having assets on your books help with other business needs?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assess Your Position</h2>

<p>Borrowing money to finance a truck is normal for drivers, owner-operators, and fleets with varying degrees of creditworthiness. The rates you’ll pay will depend on your credit, the age of your business and the condition of the truck you’re seeking to finance. As with personal credit, you’ll likely find it easier to borrow if your business has a good financial track record to show lenders. Keep in mind that a less-than-perfect credit score doesn’t exclude you from financing.</p>

<p>Depending on how long you’ve been in business, you may only have a personal credit score available to share with lenders. If this is the case, consider whether you have a regular record of on-time commercial debt payments. A history of timely and full payment in your records will go a long way to securing the financing you need on agreeable terms.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is whether you have time to improve your record before financing a truck purchase. Would it make more sense to lease in the short term, while you build up your credit? How much might you be able to set aside for a down payment to show lenders that you’ll be a model borrower?</p>

<h2>Know Where to Look, and What to Expect</h2>

<p>Unlike other forms of financing, equipment financing for trucks and truckers will largely only be available from specialty lenders familiar with the industry. The good thing about this is that you’ll be applying for and receiving financing from an entity that understands the risks and rewards associated with your specific business. Keep in mind though, with niche lenders, rates could vary across companies and there is likely to be less tolerance of missed payments or difficult circumstances. Be sure to shop around to find a lender that’s right for your business.</p>

<h2>Weigh Your Options, Make an Informed Decision</h2>

<p>Ultimately, drivers or business owners looking to secure equipment financing will want to balance all of the above in deciding what truck(s) to finance, at what cost and rates, and for how long. The pros and cons of different options will depend, on your present and future needs, your assets and projections (including the state of the market), and your creditworthiness as a borrower. Just know that there are several financing options available that are specific to equipment/truck financing. Do you research to make sure you find the right lender for your needs.</p>

1524,0,Blog Posts,The Impact of Summer Travel on Trucking,The Impact of Summer Travel on Trucking,"<p>As things started opening back up after so many COVID-19 closures, people once again began to feel more comfortable with the idea of traveling. The good news is that business operating hours, security protocols and supply chains started returning to more normal pre-pandemic status.</p>

<p>As travel increased, though, drivers ran into more traffic than usual, fuel shortages and higher fuel prices.</p>

<h2>An Increase in Summer Traffic</h2>

<p>Earlier this summer, after schools let out and the pandemic seemed to slow down, people increased their time on the roads and returned to seemingly normal schedules. Whether it was because people started going back to the office or families were going on more vacations, the amount of people driving significantly increased compared to 2020. Per a survey by Bridgestone Americas, more than half of Americans planned to take vacations this summer, and almost 80 percent felt safer in a car than on a plane.</p>

<p>Construction projects also always pick up during the second and third quarters, causing road closures, detours and traffic bottlenecks. Even with the increase in building material costs, commuters have been running into more construction delays than in the previous year. Overall, drivers and trucking companies are likely to continue experiencing more traffic and delays than usual as summer continues.</p>

<h2>Increased Fuel Pricing and Fuel Shortages</h2>

<p>According to AAA, gas prices this summer have been at their highest since 2014. Summer prices normally rise due to the special blend of fuel required for decreasing ozone emissions, but this summer the higher prices seemed primarily due to the age-old problem of high demand and low supply.</p>

<p>Fuel shortages are rampant across the country due in part to a shortage of tanker drivers, who are needed to get the fuel to its destination. Around 25% of the fuel tanker fleets are not currently operating because there are not enough drivers. Due to the special training and demanding schedule required of tanker drivers, many drivers who were forced to leave the industry last year because of low demand do not plan on returning, according to CNN.</p>

<p>Due to the high fuel demand and an ongoing shortage of drivers, the prices of fuel have been higher than ever, which could significantly impact a trucking company’s business margins.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Summer Travel</h2>

<p>Trucking companies can lessen the financial impact on day-to-day operations by preparing for the spike in traffic and increased fuel prices and shortages in advance. Signing up for a fuel card and increasing your cash flow are great ways to start preparing.</p>

1528,0,Blog Posts,3 Ways to Look for Red Flags in a Brokerage,3 Ways to Look for Red Flags in a Brokerage,"<p>There are a lot of benefits to working with brokers, but you could risk your time, money and resources by booking loads with brokerages who might be fraudulent, unreliable or inefficient. We’ve put together a few ways you can set yourself up for success.</p>

<h2>1. Check the Broker’s Credentials</h2>

<p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s website <a href=""https://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_carrquery.prc_carrlist"">search tool</a> is a great resource for identifying any major risk factors. As you look over the broker’s information, try to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is the broker’s license valid?</li>
	<li>Do they have current insurance?</li>
	<li>Are they registered with the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR) Program?</li>
	<li>Do they have an active surety bond?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can answer “yes” to these questions, the brokerage is most likely in compliance with state and federal regulations, and both legally and financially operational without major cause for concern.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can use a <strong>credit service</strong> to find credit information on brokers and shippers, including their standard days-to-pay data, authority status, MC/DOT numbers, and other important metrics. Tools like Credit in RTS Pro, an exclusive web and mobile app from <a href=""http://rtsinc.com"">RTS</a>, allow you to quickly view the information you need to make the decision on whether you want to work with a specific broker or not.</p>

<h2>2. Evaluate Their Process</h2>

<p>As a carrier, you know brokers are your lifeline for finding and getting freight from point A to point B successfully. If their process for setup, quotes, booking, payment, etc. is slow or complicated, you might find yourself stuck in the middle of a potentially risky situation.</p>

<p>So, if you’re in the early stages of working with a brokerage, what should you watch for?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Communication. </strong>Are they easy to contact? When you speak with someone, are they kind, professional, and understanding? Are they clear about expectations before, during, and after load booking and completion? Communication is perhaps the most important part of logistics. If a broker is difficult to speak with, or unclear about expectations, there is a higher chance for miscommunication resulting in load setbacks, payment delays and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Booking Loads. </strong>Are their rates fair and competitive with market rates? Do they provide options for shipment and safety tracking? Are they transparent about lanes, modes and logistics? Booking the load is an important part of the interaction but can be the most complicated part of the process, so look for brokers that make it easy and efficient.</li>
	<li><strong>Paperwork & Payment. </strong>What are the net terms? Do they reimburse lumpers? Are you expected to mail original paperwork for each load, or do they accept scanned paperwork? Do they provide easy invoicing options?</li>
	<li><strong>Finances. </strong>Perhaps the most important part of brokering a load is the financial aspect. If they expect shipper payment in 30 days (or less), but do not offer payment for 45 days (or more), it might be a red flag that they are not financially secure. If they are willing to reimburse lumpers, offer quick pay options for carriers and provide easy invoicing, you can likely trust they will pay on time and make the accounting process smooth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Trust Your Instinct</h2>

<p>Overall, the best thing to do is to trust your instinct as you begin working with a broker. If you feel that something isn’t right during the communication and booking process, you are probably right. You know your company better than anyone else, and it is important to be your own advocate to protect your business.</p>

1571,0,Blog Posts,The Nationwide Shortage of Safe Truck Parking,The Nationwide Shortage of Safe Truck Parking,"<p>For well over a decade, finding a safe place to park has been an ongoing problem for many of the country’s truck drivers. Adopted in 2012, Jason’s Law is the last major piece of federal legislation to address the shortage of safe truck parking spots. Jason’s Law was named after Jason Rivenburg who was forced to park at an abandoned gas station after not being able to find a safe place to park overnight and was subsequently murdered during a robbery in 2009. Since the law’s installation, the shortage has been addressed by a number of different national organizations but has unfortunately only gotten worse.</p>

<h2>The Current State of Truck Parking</h2>

<p>Jason’s Law, with help from the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, performed a <a href=""https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/truck_parking/jasons_law/truckparkingsurvey/index.htm"">national truck parking survey</a> concluding in 2020 that led to the following findings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Over 75% of drivers reported problems finding a safe location to park when sleep is required, at least one or more times per week (any hour of the day)</li>
	<li>Over 90% of drivers reported difficulties finding a safe place to park from 7 pm to midnight</li>
	<li>Of truck stops surveyed, 58% of respondents claimed a need for an additional 1-100 parking spots, but only a few cited a plan to increase that number of spaces</li>
	<li>Between public and private stops, there are a total of 313,000 designated truck parking spaces nationwide for the estimated 3.5 million truck drivers on the roads</li>
	<li>The states with the lowest number of spaces per 100,000 daily truck vehicle miles traveled are Maine, Ohio and Illinois</li>
	<li>The most popular unofficial and unsafe truck parking spots are freeway ramps, freeway shoulders, parking lots (private and public) and local roads</li>
</ul>

<p>According to American Trucking Associations, the time spent looking for truck parking costs the average driver somewhere around $5,500 per year (an estimated 12% cut in annual pay) and 56 minutes of drive time per day. This results in driver frustration in pay and hours, and creates a lack of trust in the system which could be significantly contributing to the overall national driver shortage.</p>

<p><img alt=""Map shows states that have and have not reported truck parking problems. The 12 States reporting no problems include Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Hawaii, and Ohio."" src=""/sites/default/files/truck-parking.png"" style=""height: 526px; width: 700px;"" /></p>

<p><em>Source: US DOT Federal Highway Administration</em></p>

<h2>What’s Being Done to Help Drivers?</h2>

<p>The truck parking shortage is receiving national attention from both government organizations and private businesses, but it is neither quick nor easy to fix.</p>

<h4><strong>Government Resolutions</strong></h4>

<p>Both federal and state organizations are attempting to address the shortage through regulations and public rest stop enhancements. States like Wyoming and Iowa are adding additional rest stops and signs denoting available parking spaces along the freeways crossing their states. Some states like Arkansas are converting former truck inspection sites to parking-only facilities. The FHWA continues to offer funding through the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act to organizations working on infrastructure developments, including public truck stop facilities and parking.</p>

<p>The biggest recent development in large-scale government legislation is the introduction of the Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act (HR 2187) in Congress in March 2021. This bill would provide grants to states, metropolitan planning organizations, local governments and other public agencies for projects that would create parking for commercial motor vehicles through 2025. This bill has unfortunately not moved past the subcommittee on Highways and Transit, and still has many stages to go through before being passed and enacted.</p>

<h4><strong>Business Actions</strong></h4>

<p>Government agencies aren’t the only ones doing something about the national parking shortage. Many national truck stops and travel center chains including Pilot Flying J, Love’s Travel Stops and TravelCenters of America (TA), are hoping to add a combined 5,600 locations and more than 7,300 parking spaces between 2020 and 2021.</p>

<p>Many private truck stops are also stepping up security measures at their locations to help drivers feel safer while resting. These measures include everything from improving camera monitoring, increasing the size of parking spaces to allow for more privacy and room to move around, adding fencing around parking zones and more.</p>

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>

<p>As the 2021 holiday season approaches, the truck parking shortage will likely become more problematic as drivers extend their hours on the road to meet high demands across the country. Additionally, government legislation is slow-moving and construction season for the businesses improving their sites is coming to an end for the year. Industry experts are hopeful, though, that 2022 will bring increased attention and urgency to move the Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act forward.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you’re a driver affected by the parking shortage, there are multiple apps and services you can use to reserve parking spots in advance like TruckPark and Trucker Path. Many travel centers also have parking reservation services on their apps, like Pilot Flying J’s Prime Parking feature.</p>

1572,0,Blog Posts,Top 3 Ways Truck Drivers Can Stay Safe on the Road,Top 3 Ways Truck Drivers Can Stay Safe on the Road,"<p>Truck drivers encounter many scenarios on each trip that could cause problems such as maintenance issues, bad weather, accidents and more. To limit the impact of these situations, it’s important to prepare yourself and/or your drivers by keeping each truck stocked with important tools and safety items, practicing preventative maintenance and emergency planning, and prioritizing driver health and safety while on the road. </p>

<h2>1. Keep Your Truck Stocked</h2>

<p>One of the biggest ways to stay prepared is keeping each truck stocked with essential tools and items that might be needed on the trip for maintenance, weather or health situations. </p>

<h4><strong>Tool Kit Essentials:</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Work gloves</li>
	<li>Tire pressure gauge</li>
	<li>Tire chains</li>
	<li>LED flashlight and batteries</li>
	<li>Zip ties</li>
	<li>Pliers</li>
	<li>Wrenches</li>
	<li>Hammer</li>
	<li>Screwdriver</li>
	<li>Pocket knife</li>
	<li>Spare parts like hoses, hubs, clamps, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>On-Duty Essentials:</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>High-visibility safety vest</li>
	<li>Up-to-date road atlas in case you lose GPS signal</li>
	<li>Phone/device chargers</li>
	<li>Road flares and cones</li>
	<li>File folders, pens, envelopes, stamps, a clipboard and other paperwork supplies</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Health and Safety Essentials:</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>First aid kit (bandages, rubbing alcohol, gauze and tape, etc.)</li>
	<li>Blanket</li>
	<li>Coat</li>
	<li>Change of clothes</li>
	<li>Non-perishable foods</li>
	<li>Water</li>
	<li>Sunglasses</li>
	<li>Soap</li>
	<li>Disinfectant wipes</li>
</ul>

<p>While this list isn’t exhaustive, it’s a great place to start for stocking your truck, and you can customize it to fit the needs of your truck and fleet. You can print this page to use as a checklist for your next trip!</p>

<h2>2. Practice Preventative Maintenance and Planning</h2>

<p>One of the easiest ways to avoid problems on the road is preventative maintenance and emergency procedure planning. While the DOT requires <a href=""https://csa.fmcsa.dot.gov/safetyplanner/MyFiles/SubSections.aspx?ch=22&sec=65&sub=148"">pre- and post-trip inspections</a>, their checklist is not always comprehensive of everything a driver should keep in mind before a trip. </p>

<h4><strong>Recommended Pre-Trip Inspection Checklist:</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Windshield glass & wipers</li>
	<li>Service brakes, brake pads and brake shoes</li>
	<li>Parking brake</li>
	<li>Tires – tread, holes, etc.</li>
	<li>Horn</li>
	<li>Steering mechanism</li>
	<li>All fluids</li>
	<li>Lights and signals</li>
	<li>All mirrors and/or cameras</li>
	<li>Air/heat system</li>
	<li>Cooling system</li>
	<li>Battery levels</li>
	<li>Coupling devices</li>
	<li><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/dictionary-trucking-terms"">ABS light</a></li>
	<li>Equipment attachments </li>
	<li>Anything else your truck has had issues with on past trips</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also use a calendar or transportation management system to track your maintenance and inspection requirements. Setting alerts or notifications to remind you of upcoming inspection requirements or repairs will help ease the stress of remembering important maintenance needs. Trucking software like <a href=""https://www.pro-transport.com/page/safety-compliance"">ProTransport</a> makes it easy for fleets of any size to manage maintenance, safety and inspection requirements.</p>

<h4><strong>Emergency Planning</strong></h4>

<p>In addition to preventative maintenance, it’s extremely important to plan ahead for possible emergency situations and have an action plan in place. There are multiple steps you can take to feel prepared for any situation that may arise while on the road:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure your emergency contact information is posted somewhere easily visible in your cab. This should include the phone number of your employer (if applicable), phone number of your spouse or close relative/friend, any allergies or important health information, etc.</li>
	<li>Have a physical list of important contact information for roadside service, your insurance company, shipper and receiver contacts, and any other stakeholders for each trip.</li>
	<li>Keep a procedure document for any situations like bad weather, maintenance emergencies, accidents, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an emergency, it’s easy to panic and forget what your next step should be. Keeping both a printed and digital document easily accessible will allow you to focus on completing each step and keep calm.</p>

<h2>3. Be Mindful While on the Road</h2>

<p>As a driver, it’s just as important to focus on health and safety while on the road as it is before a trip. It can be easy to fall into a routine, so always remember to be mindful about your health and safety as you head toward your destination.</p>

<p><strong>Health:</strong> Taking regular breaks to walk around, rest and eat nutritious meals will help keep you healthy and alert while driving. Be sure to keep any necessary medications with you at all times and stay hydrated!<br />
<strong>Parking: </strong>There is a <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/nationwide-shortage-safe-truck-parking"">national shortage of safe truck parking</a>, so planning ahead is important. While stopping for a break, you can look ahead for truck parking locations on a variety of different truck stop apps and even <a href=""https://www.pilotflyingj.com/prime-parking/"">book ahead</a> with the myRewards app from Pilot Flying J.<br />
<strong>Maintenance:</strong> Should any maintenance be required while on the road, RTS Carrier Services customers can access the free Truck Care feature in the RTS Pro app to find maintenance locations and discounts nearby. If you’re able to make a repair on your own, be sure to find a safe place to pull over and use flares or cones to alert other drivers of your presence.<br />

1573,0,Blog Posts,How to Protect Yourself from Double Brokering,How to Protect Yourself from Double Brokering,"<p>Double brokering is a hot topic in the shipping and transportation industry because of how often it happens and how big of an impact it can have on the affected parties. If you’re a carrier, it’s important to know about double brokering and how to avoid it to protect your business.</p>

<h2><strong>What is double brokering?</strong></h2>

<p>Double brokering is when a load from a shipper or <a>Freight Broker A </a>is accepted by Freight Broker B who then passes it on to a carrier as Freight Broker B’s own load. Usually this is done with the intention by Freight Broker B to increase their own profits or steal the carrier’s pay. In this scenario Freight Broker B accepts the load for a higher amount than they intend to pay the carrier, thus pocketing the difference. Or, they never intend to pay the carrier at all and keep the full amount paid to them by the initial shipper or <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/dictionary-trucking-terms#B"">broker</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the difference between double brokering and co-brokering?</strong></h2>

<p>The main difference between double brokering and co-brokering is consent by all parties involved. Co-brokering is the legal practice of multiple brokers working in tandem with the original shipper to facilitate transport with a carrier. In a co-brokering scenario, the brokers, shipper and carrier are all aware of the partnership and any commission made off the load is split among the brokers in a fair and agreed-upon manner.</p>

<p>Whereas in double brokering, there are parties who are unaware of the logistics of the load and cannot consent to payment distributions or other important aspects of the load. This forces additional liabilities on both the broker(s) and the carrier involved. As of 2013, double brokering is illegal.</p>

<h2><strong>What are the risks of hauling a double brokered load?</strong></h2>

<p>As a carrier, you assume the most risk out of anyone involved in a double brokering scam. If you accept and haul a double brokered load, you could experience any or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Denial of insurance claims if there is loss or damage to the load</li>
	<li>Lack of payment</li>
	<li>Extreme delay in payment</li>
	<li>Cancellation of FMCSA <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/dictionary-trucking-terms#A"">authority</a> or blacklisting of your company if you’re deemed involved</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How can I avoid double brokering?</strong></h2>

<p>While there is no sure way to completely avoid double brokering, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your business from being negatively impacted by this popular scam.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Establish relationships with reputable brokers.</strong> When you work on building relationships with brokers, you develop trust with them and vice versa. The more you work with a broker and haul successful loads, get paid on time, etc. the more comfortable you’ll feel continuing to haul with them.</li>
	<li><strong>Check the broker’s information.</strong> Always look for the broker’s registry on FMCSA to make sure they’re in good standing. You should also call the brokerage directly and verify the load information with them if anything seems off about the details.</li>
	<li><strong>Watch for unusually high or low rates.</strong> Rates that fall well outside of market averages signify larger problems with the load and could be indicative of false intention to pay.</li>
	<li><strong>Thoroughly review the rate confirmation and load instructions.</strong> When you receive the rate confirmation, make sure to watch for predatory instructions such as checking in under a different carrier’s name, emailing the proof of delivery to a non-brokerage address or altering the load documents in any way.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s always a good practice to <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/3-ways-identify-red-flags-when-choosing-freight-brokerage"">watch for red flags</a> in any brokerage you work with, but especially for double brokering.</p>

1583,0,Blog Posts,Your 2021 Holiday Hauling Guide,Your 2021 Holiday Hauling Guide,"<p>The 2021 peak holiday season is expected to be the most chaotic in recent history. The supply chain industry has seen record volatility over the past two years and the next few months will only get worse. This guide will help trucking companies and drivers prepare for what is already proving to be an unprecedented shipping season.</p>

<h2>Holiday Season Impacting Factors</h2>

<p>A number of problems across supply chains are causing increased uncertainty in the industry, especially leading into the peak shipping season of the year. What are the driving causes for the extreme market volatility?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Driver shortages:</strong> Industry experts estimate a shortage of over 80,000 truck drivers across the nation which means there are not enough people to get loads where they need to go at the time they’re needed.</li>
	<li><strong>Machinery shortages:</strong> Not only is there a driver shortage, but there is a shortage of trucks and truck parts. So, even if there was a driver available, they may not have a truck to haul the goods.</li>
	<li><strong>Materials shortages:</strong> Stemming from pandemic closures, manufacturers are still playing catch-up when it comes to producing and distributing raw materials, leading to a domino effect of materials shortages across supply chains.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity limits:</strong> Because of driver and machinery shortages, there are limits to the amount of capacity available to ship goods. Even if the goods are ready to be shipped, there may not be available containers, trucks, drivers or staff available to get the goods to their destination. The HOS waiver for drivers carrying pandemic-related materials is still in place, which helps aid in delivery of important materials but does not relieve other capacity restraints.</li>
	<li><strong>Price and rate increases:</strong> Because of the discrepancies with supply and demand industrywide, prices of goods have skyrocketed, and spot rates are higher than ever. The financial impact of this inflation has been felt across all supply chain stakeholders.</li>
	<li><strong>Staffing shortages:</strong> The shortage of available workers in warehouses, manufacturers, brokerages, trucking companies and more has significantly impacted how quickly and efficiently goods can be made, managed and delivered.</li>
	<li><strong>Port congestion and delays:</strong> Container shortages, driver shortages and an increase in product demand has caused ongoing congestion at every port in the nation. Even though President Biden’s administration began operating ports 24/7, there has been little relief.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Truckers Can Prepare for the Season</h2>

<p>Whether you’re an owner-operator or part of a fleet of trucks, there are three easy steps you can take to protect yourself and your business all year round, but especially during the peak season.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Work with reputable brokers.</strong> The easiest way to make it through the season is by picking up a dedicated lane, which will provide you with a stable and predictable income and schedule. If a dedicated lane isn’t available, only pick up loads with reliable and reputable brokers. By working with well-rated brokers, you reduce your risk of encountering scams like <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-protect-yourself-double-brokering"">double brokering</a> .</li>
</ol>

<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">If you’re an existing RTS customer, you can access free credit data on more than 70,000 brokers and shippers in the <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/product/rts-pro"">RTS Pro app</a>. This will help you find highly-rated brokers. You can also use the app to access our exclusive load board to find freight near you.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""2""><strong>Plan ahead for shipment delays.</strong> Because of the variety of factors contributing to supply chain chaos, delays should be expected. Shipment delays can come in the form of bad weather, pickup and delivery problems, detention and more. Drivers should thoroughly inspect their trucks before and after hauling loads to limit any <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/top-3-ways-drivers-can-stay-safe-road"">maintenance delays</a> and communicate thoroughly with their dispatch and brokerage on any issues that happen on the road. Clear, frequent communication can help relieve the stress caused by shipment problems.</li>
	<li value=""3""><strong>Prepare financially.</strong> With the influx of loads, many brokerage accounting departments will be overloaded with invoices. It’s highly likely you’ll see delayed payments and more discrepancies than normal. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and collect on any overdue invoices. If you’re looking to increase your cash flow this holiday season, RTS Financial offers <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/product/factoring-services"">same-day funding with no hidden fees</a>, and complimentary collection services on your open invoices.</li>
</ol>

<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Additionally, the fuel shortage is still causing problems around the country, and fuel prices have risen over the last few months. Be sure to plan accordingly when fueling and look for low fuel rates along your route. Fuel cards are a great way to save money at the pump, and they usually offer extended lines of credit so you don’t have to stress about your available funds while hauling a load. RTS Carrier Services provides up to $2,500 per truck, per week and <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/product/fuel-discount-program"">significant savings on fuel</a> and point-of-sale items at more than 2,000 stations nationwide.</p>

1590,0,Blog Posts,Industry Spotlight: The Current State of Cross-Border Hauling,Industry Spotlight: The Current State of Cross-Border Hauling,"<p>As peak shipping season arrives, cross-border hauling continues to pick up. Current supply chain volatility, driver shortages, strict regulations and vaccine mandates are all causing more pressure for the U.S. trucking companies and shippers moving freight across North American borders.</p>

<h2><strong>What are the factors impacting cross-border freight?</strong></h2>

<p>For shippers, <a href=""https://www.rtsinternational.com/article/how-export-your-products-united-states"">exporting goods to the United States</a> is already a complicated process. Things are further complicated by a number of issues impacting both domestic and foreign-based drivers and trucking companies.</p>

<h4>Cross-Border Hauling Regulations</h4>

<p>The U.S., Canada and Mexico all have their own regulations that apply to drivers and companies carrying international freight across North American borders. These strict regulations change frequently and cause confusion for drivers looking at loads and lanes.</p>

<p>To avoid the hassle of international driving, drivers will sometimes unload their freight at the border where it will be loaded into a truck from the destination country. But with international driver shortages, more shippers are having to rely on international hauling.</p>

<p>In the U.S., there are <a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry/cargo-security/carriers/land-carriers/how"">multiple requirements for hauling freight</a> into the country as a foreign driver which must be followed. For example, drivers entering the U.S. with foreign freight must go directly to their destination. They also cannot pick up and deliver any domestic shipments within the U.S., but they can pick up domestic freight to haul it internationally.</p>

<p>The long list of regulations varies by country, and while they are great for monitoring cross-border trade and safety, they do tend to cause delays and long delivery times because of tedious customs inspections at each border.</p>

<h4>Vaccine Mandates</h4>

<p>Starting in January 2021, non-citizen drivers entering the U.S. from Mexico or Canada will be required to show proof of vaccination. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, paper or digital proof will be accepted. The mandate is proving bittersweet, as the announcement came with the welcomed news of lifted travel bans which will help increase tourism and help local economies, especially in border communities.</p>

<p>However, in a supply chain that is already struggling with driver shortages and shipping delays, the mandate may negatively impact the number of loads coming from Mexico and Canada and cause even more delays as shippers struggle to find drivers to haul their loads into the U.S.</p>

<h4>Supply Chain Uncertainty</h4>

<p>Over the past few years, supply chain logistics and performance have been chaotic and unprecedented. The volatility has placed further stress on cross-border freight hauling. The stress can be attributed to many factors, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>High market spot rates</li>
	<li>High shipping demand</li>
	<li>Tight capacity across all truck types and hauling methods</li>
	<li>Severe port congestion</li>
	<li>Driver shortages</li>
	<li>Truck and truck part shortages</li>
	<li>COVID-19 precautionary restrictions</li>
	<li>And more</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the unpredictable nature of the current supply chain only feeds into the already stressful nature of cross-border hauling.</p>

1594,1594,Blog Posts,How to Avoid Fuel Card Fraud,How to Avoid Fuel Card Fraud,"<p>During the last few years, scammers have capitalized on the heightened public distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and now the rising fuel costs. The trucking industry is not immune to this problem; attacking fuel card customers has become a popular option for scammers. Tactics include people pretending to be an employee of your fuel card company or scamming your information right at the pump. </p>

<p>As scammers evolve, there is no sure way to completely avoid potential fraud, but there are a few things you can do to spot fraud and protect your business.</p>

<h2>How to Avoid Fuel Card Fraud</h2>

<h3>At the Pump:</h3>

<p>Scams at the pump mostly include skimming and shimming, which involves attaching devices directly to the fuel pump in an effort to read the magnetic strip or chip and get your pin number or zip code.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>Look over the card reader for anything that seems suspicious, tampered with or loose. If something doesn't seem right, go inside to pay.</li>
	<li>Check the pump for stickers or other signs that indicate the pump is regularly inspected.</li>
	<li>Use your fuel card to pay for fuel, instead of debit. If a scammer gets your debit card information, they have direct access to your bank account.</li>
	<li>If your fuel card offers mobile fueling, use it whenever possible.</li>
	<li>Try to fuel at well-lit, well-maintained stations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Over the Phone:</h3>

<p>Scammers may contact you via phone or email to ask for personal account information, claim you have late payments or fees, etc. in an attempt to access your account and steal your money.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Limit the information you share, and never give out secure information over the phone or through email (such as user ID, card number, PINs and passwords).</li>
	<li>Never click links or attachments in messages from an unknown source.</li>
	<li>If you are unsure, contact your fuel card’s customer support to verify the validity of the call or email.</li>
	<li>Keep your anti-virus software and firewall protection up to date.</li>
	<li>As a reminder, RTS Carrier Services and their providers (Fleet One and Titan) will never ask for important account details over the phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to regularly review your transaction history for any suspicious charges. If you see charges or suspect fraudulent activity on your account, reach out to your RTS account representative as soon as possible.</p>

1607,0,Blog Posts,10 Easy Ways to Stay Healthy on the Road,10 Easy Ways to Stay Healthy on the Road,"<p>Millions of people around the world use the start of the new year to make resolutions, most of which involve health and happiness. Life as a truck driver can take a toll on your mind and body, since you spend a large portion of your time sitting down and away from home. That’s why it’s especially important to practice preventative measures each day to keep yourself happy and healthy, and ensure you continue to <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-fail-dot-physical"">pass DOT physicals</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re one of those millions looking for ways to be healthier, we’ve compiled a list of easy things you can do to start.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Start Small</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps the most important takeaway from this list is to take small steps. Overhauling your entire routine is not realistic or sustainable, so even choosing two or three things from this list to start with can make a huge impact over time. Choose things that seems easily attainable for you, and as you begin forming long-term healthy habits, add onto your efforts with additional goals.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""2""><strong>Use Sunscreen</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Long-term exposure to the sun can be detrimental to your skin; being in a truck does not shield you from the UV rays entering through your windows. Applying sunscreen each day, even just to your face and hands, can help protect you from developing skin cancer and other dermatological conditions caused by long-term sun exposure.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""3""><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The recommended water intake is 64 ounces, or one gallon, per day. You can increase your water intake by keeping gallons or bottled water handy in your truck or refilling a reusable bottle when you stop for fuel. Avoid drinking too much coffee, soda or energy drinks because they reduce your hydration levels and can also interfere with sleep schedules. Replacing sugary drinks with water (even naturally flavored or sparkling) will boost your hydration.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""4""><strong>Practice Good Hygiene</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>While it may seem obvious, poor hygiene can actually lead to systemic health problems. Prioritizing cleanliness while working is essential to avoiding catching illnesses and experiencing issues like gum disease, rashes and other infections. Always be sure to wash your hands after using frequently used items like fuel pumps, restrooms, etc., brush your teeth twice a day, dispose of trash properly and shower frequently. Also be sure to pack a first aid kit in case of emergency!</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""5""><strong>Make Healthy Food Choices</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Being on the road makes finding healthier food choices difficult, especially in more remote areas of the country that don’t have convenient food options. There are a few ways to make nutritious food decisions while on the road:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pre-pack as many snacks and meals as possible to keep from impulsively buying fast food. Items like fruits, vegetables, cheese sticks, pretzels, nuts, etc. are great options for on-the-go.</li>
	<li>Supplement your food intake with daily multi-vitamins.</li>
	<li>When ordering from a restaurant, choose options like salads, lean meats, etc. when possible.</li>
	<li>Make small, healthier substitutions like vegetables instead of fries, leaving off cheese, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Be sure to consult your doctor for specific nutrition and dietary advice prior to making substantial changes.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""6""><strong>Get Good Rest</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Allowing your body to rest properly is crucial to maintaining overall health. If you’re having trouble sleeping while on the road, try things like ear plugs, eye masks and noise machines to help you drown out your surroundings. You can also find ways to destress before sleeping, like reading, meditating or stretching, which will help calm your mind and body to allow for a better night’s sleep.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""7""><strong>Exercise Your Body</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Moving your body is an excellent way to stay healthy. Getting adequate movement doesn’t have to involve large-scale workouts; just taking short walks or doing small cardio activities when you stop can make a huge difference. There are a lot of great fitness apps and YouTube videos available for free that can help you get started with small movement exercises at whatever level you’re comfortable with. You can also stock your truck with portable workout equipment like resistance bands, small hand weights, a yoga mat, etc.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""8""><strong>Exercise Your Brain</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Working your brain is just as important as working your body! Stimulating your brain each day can help you stay sharp and aware, especially when done regularly over time. While on the road, you can keep your brain working by listening to educational and engaging content like podcasts or audiobooks. You can also do logic puzzles, trivia, etc. while on your breaks to squeeze in mental workouts.  </p>

<ol>
	<li value=""9""><strong>Monitor Your Posture</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Posture is something that is often overlooked but becomes a serious issue for many truck drivers. Being hunched over the wheel in a seated position for long hours during the day can take a huge toll on your health over time. While driving, be sure to keep your seat high and your elbows tucked to keep your back in a neutral, upright position as much as possible. Investing in lumbar and tailbone support cushions can help you take care of your neck, back and hips while on the road. You can also find posture monitoring devices and braces if you notice your posture worsening or causing severe pain. Always speak with your doctor to find the best methods for you.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""10""><strong>Avoid Unnecessary Stress</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Last but not least, avoiding unnecessary stress is a great way to stay healthy and happy. One of the best ways to do this is to plan ahead and be prepared as much as possible.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/top-3-ways-drivers-can-stay-safe-road"">Practice preventative maintenance and keep your truck stocked</a> with items you may need</li>
	<li>Avoid financial strain and potential <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-avoid-fuel-card-fraud"">fraudulent situations</a></li>
	<li>Plan your routes and fuel stops ahead of time, and have physical maps on hand in case you lose signal</li>
	<li>Drive safely and defensively to avoid accidents, claims and load damage</li>
	<li>Check load cargo details prior to booking a load to make sure your insurance covers that cargo item</li>
	<li>Verify a broker’s credit history prior to booking loads to ensure they will pay you on time</li>
</ul>

<p>By taking preventative measures to avoid stress, you will save yourself time, money and resources each time you’re on the road.</p>

1610,0,Blog Posts,A Look at the 2022 First Quarter Fuel Market,A Look at the 2022 First Quarter Fuel Market,"<p>Over the past two years, fuel prices have been a on a rollercoaster ride, swinging from low to high and everything in between. With recent fuel shortages and higher demand, prices have gone up significantly from where they fell early in the pandemic. In November 2020, the average rate for diesel was $2.37, rising to more than $3.73 per gallon during the same time in 2021. What can we expect with fuel prices for the first few months in 2022?</p>

<h2><strong>Surges in Fuel Demand</strong></h2>

<p>The surge in demand for oil beginning in 2021, combined with a very slow response from the global oil industry, has caused energy costs and inflation percentages to soar. With rail, air and road travel booming again, the supply chain can’t keep up with the demand for oil and natural gases which has led to shortages and higher rates as oil providers burn through their stored supplies quickly.</p>

<h2><strong>Fuel Rates May Continue to Rise</strong></h2>

<p>The Department of Energy reported the average rate for Brent crude oil averaged $84 a barrel in October 2021, up $43 from October 2020. Crude prices have not been this high for almost an entire decade, in part due to higher supply chain expenses and delays, increased shipping demand from the holidays, tanker driver shortages and more. Additionally, fuel stop employee wages and costs are higher than ever, contributing to higher rates of fuel.</p>

<p>If the country experiences a high amount of inclement weather and frigid temperatures, natural gas supplies may experience shortages leading to a higher consumption of diesel, which is used as a substitute for natural gas. If diesel usage rises, so may the rates.</p>

<p>Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service, <a href=""https://www.ccjdigital.com/economic-trends/article/15281617/diesel-prices-expected-to-continue-upward-trend-this-winter"">reported to CCJ Digital</a> that he expects higher fluctuation in diesel prices this quarter than for gasoline, with an increase to roughly $4 a gallon nationwide. He forecasts those rates may decline after the first few months.</p>

<h2><strong>Watch for a Decline Mid-2022</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, diesel and gasoline rates may continue to climb steadily for the first part of 2022. However, based on current projections from the Department of Energy and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, supply will hopefully outpace demand mid-2022 leading to a decline in rates across the country.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an easy way to save on fuel expenses, RTS Carrier Services offers an average savings of 25 cents per gallon at more than 2,000 fuel stations nationwide.</p>

1616,0,Blog Posts,Should I Repair or Replace My Semi-Truck?,Should I Repair or Replace My Semi-Truck?,"<p>The transportation industry is seeing an unprecedented shortage in drivers, trucks and truck maintenance parts all stemming from pandemic-related closures, delays, raw material shortages and staffing issues. These shortages are causing severe delays and high prices in the truck-buying market, both new and used, which makes the decision to repair or replace your truck even more important. If you’re wondering whether you should continue to make repairs to your aging truck, or upgrade to a newer or better one, there are a lot of things to consider before you make your final decision.</p>

<h2><strong>Should I repair my semi-truck or buy a new one?</strong></h2>

<p>If you’re starting with this question, there are a few additional questions you’ll need to ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How much can you afford to spend on your truck each month? The cost of <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/why-leasing-might-be-best-way-build-your-fleet"">leasing a new truck</a> can range from $1,600-$2,500 per month, owning a new truck can range from $2,000-$3,000, and owning a used truck can range from $800-$1,600.</li>
	<li>How much is your current truck costing you, per mile?</li>
	<li>Do you have the <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/equipment-financing-truckers"">cash flow or financing</a> available to upgrade your truck?</li>
	<li>How long will you be in the industry? Is it worth upgrading right now?</li>
	<li>Would it make more sense for you, financially, to work for a fleet that provides equipment?</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What to Consider if You are Repairing Your Semi-Truck</strong></h2>

<p>If you’re interested in keeping your current truck and just repairing as needed, you should first <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-calculate-fuel-cost-mile-your-trucks"">calculate how much your truck is costing you, per mile</a>. If it is costing you more than 13-14 cents per mile, you’re likely spending too much; new trucks can cost as little as 5 cents per mile.</p>

<p>You should also consider any other big repairs you may have coming in the next several weeks, months and years. Will you need an engine rebuild, new brakes, updated emissions equipment, etc.? These costs can add up quickly, making it more beneficial to consider buying a newer truck. Additionally, if these maintenance issues are keeping you from delivering on your deadlines, or creating safety problems for you or others, it might make more sense to upgrade.</p>

<p>Lastly, outsourcing labor-intensive repairs can cost a lot of time and money that you may not be prepared for. If you know how to do most of your repairs and maintenance work yourself, you can save a lot of money on labor costs, which means you could justify repairing your current truck for a longer time. You can always join a maintenance savings program, like the <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/rts-announces-partnership-southern-tire-mart"">partnership between RTS and Southern Tire Mart</a>, to get discounts on repairs you might need.</p>

<p>NOTE: Always prioritize safety and inspection requirements when considering whether to make repairs yourself versus outsourcing to experts.</p>

<h2><strong>What to Consider if You are Buying a New Semi-Truck</strong></h2>

<p>The decision to buy (or lease) a new truck is never an easy one; there are a lot of components that go into purchasing and/or financing a new vehicle, especially with many OEMs on a <a href=""https://www.freightwaves.com/news/inability-to-produce-pushes-class-8-orders-to-lowest-november-in-26-years"">14-month lead time</a> due to pandemic-related delays. As you begin your search, ask yourself the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is the dealer you’re working with reputable?</li>
	<li>What kind of warranty is included with your purchase? Do they offer an extended warranty?</li>
	<li>Would buying the truck outright, financing or leasing be the best option for you?</li>
	<li>If financing, what are your financing options?</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What to Consider if You are Buying a Used Semi-Truck</strong></h2>

<p>Used trucks provide an opportunity to upgrade from your current tractor without the financial burden of purchasing a new one. However, used truck rates have skyrocketed due to current truck shortages so you want to ensure you’re making a smart decision by considering the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Has the truck been well-maintained? Is there a record of the maintenance?</li>
	<li>How often was the oil changed?</li>
	<li>Will anything major need replaced soon? (If it’s over 700,000 miles, you should prepare for an engine rebuild).</li>
	<li>What is the tire tread depth? Will you need to purchase new tires?</li>
	<li>Is the dealer reputable, and do they offer a warranty?</li>
	<li>Does the truck meet the specs you need for the type of loads you typically haul?</li>
	<li>Does it meet regulations you need to comply with, such as emissions or noise regulations?</li>
	<li>Are there any fleets upgrading to newer models that you could purchase from?</li>
	<li>Are you paying in cash, or will you need to secure financing?</li>
</ul>

1619,0,Blog Posts,IFTA Fuel Taxes: How to File the Easy Way,IFTA Fuel Taxes: How to File the Easy Way,"<p>The <a href=""https://www.iftach.org/"">International Fuel Tax Agreement</a> was implemented by the lower 48 states and ten Canadian provinces to make it easier for interstate motor carriers to file and report their fuel taxes collectively, rather than with each state independently. However, each quarter, it remains a complicated and time-consuming pain point for truckers and fleets of all sizes.</p>

<p>The good news? There’s an easier way to tackle the IFTA fuel tax than you might be used to – your reports could be ready in just a few clicks. But first, let’s cover the basics.</p>

<h2><strong>Who Needs to File IFTA?</strong></h2>

<p>Before filing, you’ll want to make sure you actually qualify to file. The following carriers are required to file quarterly IFTA fuel tax reports:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Vehicles with two axles and a gross vehicle weight rating or registered gross vehicle weight above 26,000 pounds</li>
	<li>Vehicles of any weight with three or more axles</li>
	<li>Any combination of vehicles with a total gross vehicle weight or weight rating more than 26,000 pounds</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>When is IFTA Due?</strong></h2>

<p>While specific filing dates may vary slightly each year, the standard IFTA filing deadlines are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>First quarter</strong> – April 30*</li>
	<li><strong>Second quarter</strong> – July 31*</li>
	<li><strong>Third quarter</strong> – October 31</li>

<h2><strong>The Pain Points of Filing IFTA Manually</strong></h2>

<p>If you’ve been through the process of filing your IFTA fuel tax reports in the past, you know it comes with challenges. In order to successfully file IFTA without a filing software, you typically have to keep all of your fuel receipts and organize them by state, ensure your duty logs are current and record every single mile you drive.</p>

<p>These processes are extremely time-consuming and require detailed records that are often hard to keep organized while on the road or managing fleets with multiple trucks and drivers.</p>

<p>But, there is an easier way!</p>

<h2><strong>The Benefits of Using IFTA Fuel Tax Software</strong></h2>

<p>There are many software options available for owner-operators and fleets looking for ways to save time and energy on IFTA filing each quarter. Typically, these programs integrate with your electronic logging devices (ELDs), fuel transactions and more to make your reporting easier. Because the software tracks the important details for you, it saves you the time of manually logging records and keeping track of receipts while on the road. And more often than not, you’re able to calculate your reports with just a few clicks!</p>

1621,0,Blog Posts,5 Women Who Shaped the Trucking Industry,5 Women Who Shaped the Trucking Industry,"<p>In celebration of Women’s History Month, we’re honoring women who have shaped the transportation industry. These industry pioneers paved the way for a more diverse transportation workforce and made valuable contributions to the industry.</p>

<h2><strong>Mary Fields: 1832-1914</strong><img src=""https://cdn.britannica.com/60/198160-050-C8BE030F/Mary-Fields.jpg"" style=""float: right; height: 203px; width: 300px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 50px;"" /></h2>

<p>Mary Fields was the first female mail carrier to run the Star Route in the United States. Born into slavery in 1832 and freed in 1914, Fields started working at the U.S. Postal Service at the age of 60 and was the second woman to ever join the organization’s workforce. She sometimes went by “Stagecoach Mary,” and drove her route equipped with a rifle on her shoulder and a .38 Smith & Wesson revolver tucked beneath her apron to protect herself from thieves and bandits. Every day, Mary could be found leading her team of six horses and a mule named Moses along their route. She was fearless and determined, and her courage led to more women participating in transportation.</p>

<h2><strong>Luella Bates: 1897-1985</strong><img alt=""Luella Bates | US Department of Transportation"" src=""https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/1918%20Luella%20Bates.jpg"" style=""height: 244px; width: 200px; float: right; margin: 50px;"" /></h2>

<p>Luella Bates was the first female truck driver in United States history. At the start of World War I, she and approximately 150 other women were hired as test drivers by Four Wheel Drive (FWD), an auto company in Clintonville, Wisconsin. They were meant to be stand-ins for men who had gone off to war, but Bates remained on the staff as a driver and demonstrator long after the war had ended. A master mechanic, Bates managed all the maintenance on her truck. Her passion for the profession and impressive proficiency continue to inspire other women to take their place in the big rig driver’s seat.</p>

<h2><strong>Lillie Elizabeth Drennan: 1897-1974</strong><img alt="""" src=""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Lillie_Elizabeth_Drennan.png/225px-Lillie_Elizabeth_Drennan.png"" style=""height: 220px; width: 225px; float: right; margin: 50px;"" /></h2>

<p>The first licensed female truck driver, Lillie Drennan fought tirelessly to challenge the norms of the male-dominated trucking industry. She and her second husband started their own trucking company at the height of the oil boom in 1928. They hauled a variety of materials, including high-risk shipments of TNT and dynamite. At first, it was just her husband behind the wheel, but when business started to pick up, Drennan began making deliveries as well. Soon, they grew their fleet and hired additional drivers, and eventually, Drennan became the sole owner. She had a flawless safety record, despite having a severe hearing impairment. Drennan stands out as a trailblazer not only because of her title as the first licensed woman truck driver but also because she regularly fought against gender and disability bias in the industry.</p>

<p>Lois Cooper was the first female African American transportation engineer to be hired in the California Department of Transportation Engineering Department.  Not only was she the first black woman (and second woman) in California to pass the Professional Engineers (PE License) Exam, but she was also the first female director of the First Diamond Lane, the predecessor to carpool lanes. She was a fantastic mathematician, an advocate for STEM education and a champion of Civil Rights.</p>

<p>Adriesue “Bitsy” Gomez grew up admiring truck drivers. A single mother of three daughters, Gomez followed her heart and started driving professionally to support her family. She soon witnessed the discrimination embedded in the transportation sector and sought to make waves. In the 1970s, she founded the Coalition of Women Truck Drivers, a 150-member organization that challenged sexism and discrimination in the trucking industry. The group fought to increase the number of women’s restrooms at truck stops and more. Throughout her life, she remained committed to making the trucking industry a safer and more inclusive space for women.</p>

<p>While there is still much progress to be made for diversity and inclusion in the trucking industry, these women – and so many more – have contributed to the <a href=""https://www.freightwaves.com/news/number-of-women-behind-the-wheel-soars-year-over-year"">rate of women behind the wheel growing each year</a>. And now, women make up more than 40 percent of the non-executive trucking workforce, but only 19 percent of executives.</p>

<p>Thank you to the women in the industry who have made history and pushed for progress, and to the women who continue to do so each day.</p>

1629,0,Blog Posts,4 Easy Ways to Improve Your Finances as a Trucker,4 Easy Ways to Improve Your Finances as a Trucker,"<p>As inflation rises, you may be nervous about your financial situation and how to keep your business operating smoothly. We know it’s difficult to manage your money while also being on the road, so we’ve compiled four easy ways for you to improve your financial health.</p>

<h2>4 Easy Ways to Improve Your Finances</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Budget</li>
	<li>Increase Your Cashflow</li>
	<li>Keep Up with Due Dates</li>
	<li>Protect Yourself</li>
</ol>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>The biggest method of improving your financial health is assessing your complete financial situation. You can start by creating a budget for your expected income and expenses (typically by month or quarter) and identifying any gaps using the following steps.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<h4><strong>Estimate Income</strong></h4>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>As a trucker, it may be difficult to get an exact estimate of your monthly or quarterly income. So, if you fluctuate a lot, look at the same time period for last year and use that number. Alternatively, you can total your income from the previous year and divide it by twelve months for a monthly average. Try not to include any bonuses, gifts, tax returns, etc., as those are not guaranteed.</p>

<ol>
	<li value=""2"">
	<h4><strong>Calculate Expenses</strong></h4>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Make a complete list of all your expenses. Since the recommended budget changes monthly or quarterly, you’ll want to take any annual expenses and divide them by twelve (for months) or four (for quarters) and assign a portion of that expense to your savings account each month so you aren’t surprised by the amount when it becomes due. If you’re struggling to find your expenses, you can go through your credit card or bank account transaction list for the past year, or use the following list to get you started:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rent/mortgage</li>
	<li>Utilities (phone, internet, gas, water, sewage, electricity, etc.)</li>
	<li>Insurance (health, dental, vision, car, home, etc.)</li>
	<li>Gas/fuel</li>
	<li>Loan payments (car, education, etc.)</li>
	<li>Groceries/food</li>
	<li>Pet costs</li>
	<li>Prescriptions</li>
	<li>Subscriptions (music, television, apps, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li value=""3"">
	<h4><strong>Identify Gaps</strong></h4>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you’ve totaled your income and expenses, find the difference between the two. If your income is more than your expenses, invest those funds into an interest-building savings account through your bank, or use a financial advisor to help you make an informed decision about alternative investment methods.</p>

<p>If your expenses are more than your income, it’s time to figure out ways you can save money and increase your cash flows, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prioritizing your physical health to <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/10-easy-ways-stay-healthy-road"" target=""_blank"">stay healthy on the road</a> and avoid unnecessary medical expenses</li>
	<li>Plan ahead for meals and pack what you can so you aren’t buying meals at restaurants</li>
	<li>Use budget and coupon apps* to quickly assess your spending and find ways to save on typical expenses</li>
	<li>Participate in a fuel card program for fuel savings, and factor your invoices for additional cash flow (we’ll discuss this more later)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Budget apps like Mint, Zeta or Personal Capital allow you to track income and expenses by category, identify savings opportunities, etc. Coupon apps like Rakuten, Honey and Ibotta offer quick savings for many different retailers.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even if your expenses are more than your income, it’s important to establish an emergency savings fund, so try to include at least a small amount of savings into your expense category. By establishing a habit of building up your savings account, you’ll ensure financial safety in case of an emergency.</p>

<h2>Increase Your Cashflow</h2>

<p>There are two simple ways for trucking companies to increase cashflow: fuel card programs and factoring services.</p>

<h4><strong>Fuel Card Program</strong></h4>

<p>Most <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/how-does-trucking-fuel-card-work"" target=""_blank"">fuel card programs</a> offer a line of credit for fuel purchases so you don’t have to take fuel funds directly from your bank account. But one of the most important parts of a fuel card is the savings potential; you can receive additional discounts off the cash price of fuel and point-of-sale purchases, special access to maintenance offers and more. These savings mean extra money for other expenses.</p>

<h4><strong>Invoice Factoring</strong></h4>

<p>If you’re not familiar with invoice factoring, it is the process of selling your load invoices to a financing company for a small fee. During this process, you receive an agreed-upon amount up front (up to 100% of your advance amount) and the company takes over the process of collecting the amount from your customer. By factoring your invoices, you immediately increase your cashflow and save time on the collections process, allowing you to focus on hauling and managing your business.</p>

<p><strong>RTS offers both <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/page/contact-us?utm_source=rts&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=improvefinances"" target=""_blank"">fuel and factoring services</a></strong>, and bundling your services allows you to save even more! We have fuel card options for any credit score, with savings at 2,000+ fuel locations, 200+ Truck Care service centers and more. Plus, get funded in 24 hours with no hidden fees, upload invoices easily and access exclusive freight all in our free app, RTS Pro.</p>

<h2>Keep Up with Due Dates</h2>

<p>It’s important to pay bills on time to avoid extra fees or penalties for late payments. Most financial institutions offer a short grace period but setting up automatic payments or reminders for yourself prior to payment dates is a helpful way to avoid these fees. Additionally, be sure to file your personal and business taxes on time and <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/ifta-fuel-taxes-how-file-easy-way"" target=""_blank"">submit IFTA reports</a> each quarter.</p>

<h2>Protect Yourself</h2>

<p>Part of excellent financial health is proactively avoiding negative financial experiences. Remain vigilant against fuel and credit card fraud and scams, watch out for theft while parked, and avoid claims on your loads by practicing defensive driving and performing pre-trip inspections.</p>

<p>You can also protect yourself and your business by <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/3-ways-identify-red-flags-when-choosing-freight-brokerage"" target=""_blank"">identifying red flags in brokerages</a> prior to booking loads, and <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-protect-yourself-double-brokering"" target=""_blank"">spotting potential double brokering</a> before you become a victim.</p>

1634,0,Blog Posts,3 Ways Truck Drivers Can Be Eco-Friendly,3 Ways Truck Drivers Can Be Eco-Friendly,"<p>Every April the celebration of Earth Day is met with advice on how to “go green” to protect our planet, but truck drivers and other mobile professionals are met with unique challenges. The culture in the United States is often focused on convenience rather than sustainability, so we’ve compiled the top three ways you can be eco-friendly while on the road.</p>

<h2>How to Stay Eco-Friendly as a Truck Driver:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Recycle</li>
	<li>Reduce waste and reuse items when possible</li>
	<li>Optimize fuel efficiency</li>
</ol>

<h2>Recycle</h2>

<p>The most common way to be sustainable is through recycling. Being on the road sometimes makes recycling difficult, but it <em>is</em> possible! To make recycling easier, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep a dedicated container in your truck to store recyclable products until you find a drop-off location.</li>
	<li>Use Earth911 to <a href=""https://search.earth911.com/?utm_source=earth911-header"">find recycling stations near you</a> and <a href=""https://earth911.com/recycling-center-search-guides/?utm_source=earth911-header"">review recycling guidelines</a>.</li>
	<li>Hang onto plastic bags (like you would get from a grocery store) and deposit them at an <a href=""https://www.plasticfilmrecycling.org/recycling-bags-and-wraps/find-drop-off-location/"">approved site</a>.</li>
	<li>Recycle batteries, tires and other automotive products when you upgrade your truck.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reduce and Reuse</h2>

<p>You can help limit your waste by reducing unnecessary paper and plastic usage and reusing items when possible. For example, try going paperless! Your ELD already helps reduce paper waste as you log your hours, but you can also scan and upload documents digitally instead of mailing them using a document scanning app. For example, <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/product/rts-pro"">RTS Pro</a>, our mobile app, offers an easy document uploading process for factoring customers.</p>

<p>You can also plan for your trips by packing a fabric tote bag and reusable water bottle, and bringing your snacks and food in reusable containers to cut down on the amount of single-use plastics you accumulate along the way.</p>

<h2>Optimize Fuel Efficiency</h2>

<p>The most effective way to decrease your <a href=""https://www.conservation.org/stories/what-is-a-carbon-footprint"">carbon footprint</a> is to increase your fuel efficiency by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plan your routes ahead of time. This avoids unnecessary fuel usage by using the shortest route and avoiding traffic.</li>
	<li>Fill up your tank in the morning. Because fuel expands in the heat, filling up when it’s cooler means you’ll get more gas in your tank and have to fill up less often.</li>
	<li>Avoid idling your truck. If you know you’ll be sitting somewhere for a while, turn your truck off instead of using fuel to idle.</li>
	<li>Maintain normal speeds while driving. Frequently changing speeds uses more fuel and increases the wear and tear on your vehicle.</li>
	<li>Use less air conditioning if and when possible. A/C increases your fuel consumption and decreases efficiency.</li>
	<li>Keep up on truck maintenance. Not only will preventative maintenance help you avoid big-ticket repairs, but you’ll reduce your emissions by keeping your filters clean and your truck running smoothly.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for more ways to reduce fuel emissions and save on fuel costs and truck maintenance, our RTS Carrier Services team can help!</p>

1641,0,Blog Posts,How to Prepare for CVSA’s International Roadcheck Inspections,How to Prepare for CVSA’s International Roadcheck Inspections,"<p>The 2023 International Roadcheck, a <a href=""https://www.cvsa.org/news/2023-international-roadcheck/"">North American inspection blitz</a> hosted by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA), is set for May 16 - 18. The 72-hour high-velocity inspection cycle is held each year in an effort to keep roads and drivers safe.</p>

<h2>CVSA Inspections: The Basics</h2>

<p>Inspections can be held at weigh stations, border checkpoints, bus terminals, carrier terminals or during any roadside traffic stop. During the inspection blitz, the CVSA is watching for four main violation categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Driver violations</li>
	<li>Out-of-service drivers</li>
	<li>Vehicle defects</li>
	<li>Out-of-service vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>There are eight levels of inspection, but during the International Roadcheck, inspectors commonly focus on Levels One and Two.</p>

<h4><strong>Level One: North American Standard Inspection</strong></h4>

<p>The Level One inspection is a 37-step overview of both the driver and the vehicle, including paperwork (licensure, inspection reports, hours of service, etc.), alcohol and drug use, brake systems, lighting, steering and more.</p>

<h4><strong>Level Two: Walk-Around Driver/Vehicle Inspection</strong></h4>

<p>The Level Two inspection is a 31-step review including most of the Level One items but does not require the inspector to get underneath the vehicle.</p>

<h4><strong>2023 Inspection Focus:</strong> <strong>ABS and Cargo Securement</strong></h4>

<p>The CVSA announced this year’s blitz will focus on anti-lock brakes and cargo securement. ABS violations are not out-of-service violations, however, anti-lock brakes prevent the wheels from locking up or skidding, which allows the driver to maintain control of the vehicle while braking and reduces the risk of collisions. Additionally, improper cargo securement can seriously impact a vehicle's maneuverability and may also result in unsecured loads falling, causing traffic hazards, vehicle collisions and overall increased risk to drivers and other vehicles on the road.</p>

<h4><strong>How to Prepare for CVSA Inspections</strong></h4>

<p>If you’re worried about yourself or your fleet during the upcoming inspection blitz, there are a few things you can do to prepare.</p>

<p>1. Perform <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/top-3-ways-drivers-can-stay-safe-road"">pre-trip inspections</a> before every trip, and be sure to check:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brakes</li>
	<li>Axles</li>
	<li>Tractor protection system</li>
	<li>Brake system warning devices</li>
	<li>Air loss rate</li>
	<li>Steering wheel lash</li>
	<li>Fifth wheel movement</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Make sure you have all the required tools on board and that they’re in working order. Missing or broken fire extinguishers account for a large number of violations each year, so every item counts!</p>

<p>3. Audit your paperwork before each trip to ensure you have all the required documentation and that it is legible. Documents can include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Permits (if applicable)</li>
	<li>Periodic inspection report</li>
	<li>Daily vehicle inspection report (if applicable)</li>
	<li>Record of duty status</li>
</ul>

<p>Not everyone will receive an inspection, but if you successfully pass a Level One, you’ll receive a CVSA decal sticker to display, which exempts the vehicle from another Level One inspection for three months.</p>

<p>If you find you need some repairs or want to schedule preventative maintenance, RTS Carrier Services customers receive discounts and special offers at more than 200 truck care service centers across the country.</p>

<p>A fuel card is a card that a driver carries with them while they’re on the road to pay for fuel and other authorized purchases. While fuel cards are popular for owner-operators, they can also be beneficial for fleets (local, over-the-road or a mix of both) by helping save money, improve security and streamline operations.</p>

<h2>Benefit #1: Savings</h2>

<p>The first perk that draws companies to a fuel card for their fleets is the ability to save money. Most fuel card programs offer discounts off the cash price of diesel, and some even offer savings on maintenance and point-of-sale items.</p>

<p>By using a fuel card program for your company drivers, it’s easier to enforce the company spending policy. Most fuel card options for fleets allow you to set spending limits or controls based on the type of product, dollar amount, time of day, etc., so your employees don’t overspend or buy things they shouldn’t with company funds.</p>

<h2>Benefit #2: Security</h2>

<p>As your fleet grows and drivers come and go, it’s important to protect your bottom line. Supplying each of your drivers with a fuel card through the same program allows you to view their spending through <strong>real-time transaction monitoring</strong>. Want even more details? Fuel card programs like the Mixed Fleet card from RTS Carrier Services allow you to set up alerts based on certain behaviors such as overspending, off-hour purchases, etc.</p>

<p>Since cash is difficult to track, using a fuel card also reduces the amount of theft and loss companies experience with cash purchases of fuel. Plus, the contactless payment option of a fuel card reduces potential contact with card skimmers at the pump, helping to <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-avoid-fuel-card-fraud"">avoid fuel card fraud</a>.</p>

<h2>Benefit #3: Streamlined Operations</h2>

<p>When you use the same fuel card for your entire fleet, including both gasoline and diesel vehicles, you’ll see a major improvement in your business operations, because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The contactless card is easier and faster than cash for drivers to use at the pump.</li>
	<li>Easy transaction tracking means you don’t have to collect receipts from drivers.</li>
	<li>The RTS Mixed Fleet card is accepted at 95% of gas stations and 2,000+ truck stops.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the custom reporting features, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Track your entire fuel spend in one place.</li>
	<li>View a daily savings report.</li>
	<li>Analyze fleet fuel efficiency.</li>
	<li>Compile IFTA reports quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>And when you use the RTS Mixed Fleet card, you can use the free RTS Pro web and mobile app to find:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fuel and maintenance discounts based on location or route.</li>
	<li>Free credit data on shippers/brokers.</li>
	<li>Exclusive freight through Ryan Transportation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, providing your entire fleet with the same card no matter the type of vehicle will offer you vast improvements in savings, security and operations.</p>

<p>This year’s National Transportation Week is May 16 – May 20. How are you celebrating with your team? Whether it’s hauling cargo on trucks or transporting people on planes, the transportation industry is critical to how the United States functions. The national holiday to acknowledge and appreciate transportation-industry personnel was <a href=""https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ntw.htm"">declared in 1999</a> by President Bill Clinton and has been celebrated each year since.</p>

<p><q>Throughout America's history, our transportation system has played a profound role in the security and development of our Nation. As early as the Revolutionary War, America's merchant marine carried cargo to help defend our national interests and uphold our democratic ideals. In the 1800's, as many Americans migrated westward, new roads and canals facilitated travel and trade, helping to unify our young country and to bolster our growing economy. And in the 20th century, few innovations have had the same far-reaching effect on our society as the airplane -- now a critical part of our national defense and our robust economy.</q> - From the White House’s holiday proclamation, May 17, 1999</p>

<p>These words still ring true today! The transportation industry has evolved over the years but has played a crucial role in the lives of Americans every step of the way.</p>

<p>Pilot Flying J continues to monitor the global supply market closely, doing everything they can to keep customers updated, informed and fueled. According to Pilot Flying J, the tremendous volatility in crude and product prices is being driven by two opposing factors:</p>

<ol>
	<li>There have been extreme lockdowns in some of China’s major cities due to high COVID cases, resulting in less Chinese demand for oil supplies and overall downward pressure on oil prices.</li>
	<li>There is continued pressure on the European Union to curtail oil and gas supplies coming out of Russia, resulting in upward pressure in pricing for oil and refined products globally.</li>
</ol>

<p>Diesel inventory levels remain extremely low for many markets in the eastern U.S., and refinery issues are creating tightness in both the St. Louis and Indianapolis markets. To prepare for market disruptions like these, Pilot Flying J has spent the last several years building a resilient supply chain. They are also taking additional action to secure extra supply, including mobilizing their fleet to deliver diesel to areas facing the tightest availability, such as Virginia and Georgia. At this time, all other markets are adequately supplied with contingency plans to ensure that Pilot Flying J locations nationwide can continue to provide a steady source of diesel fuel for fleets.</p>

<p>At RTS, we are confident that Pilot will closely monitor the situation and actively mitigate any outages, ensuring they remain the most reliable network of travel centers for our customers.</p>

1720,0,Blog Posts,Why Diversity in the Trucking Industry Matters,Why Diversity in the Trucking Industry Matters,"<p>You may not have considered the gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion, sexual orientation, ability or disability and background of your truck drivers and staff, but <a href=""https://www.truckinginfo.com/10177135/the-business-case-for-diversity-in-trucking"">this is an important topic for trucking companies</a>. Actively seeking truck driver diversity among your applicants gives you the opportunity to gain unique insights from your truck drivers and expand the sense of community among the employees in your trucking company.</p>

<h2>Who needs diverse truck drivers and staff?</h2>

<p>All industries, including the trucking industry, can benefit from prioritizing diversity and inclusion. Your trucking company should put some thought into considering the benefits of accurately representing genders, races, ages, abilities and more when selecting your truck drivers, back-office staff and leadership.</p>

<h2>What does diversity in the trucking industry look like?</h2>

<p>A sustainability survey in 2020 received results from respondents declaring that 64% identified their trucking company as being 51% owned and operated by members of one or more diverse groups. Also in 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/5-women-who-shaped-trucking-industry"">women made up 12.4% of the trucking workforce</a>. In 2018, 40.4% of truck drivers identified as minorities according to the 2019 American Trucking Associations’ <a href=""https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/ATAs%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202019%20with%20cover.pdf"">Truck Driver Shortage Analysis</a>.</p>

<p>These numbers are steadily rising and making room for diversity due to an expanding industry, driver shortages and retirements. Your trucking company can be a direct contributor in this increasing attention to diversity and inclusion.</p>

<h2>What do diverse truck drivers and staff have to offer?</h2>

<p>Having a diverse group of employees means new perspectives and different experiences that can be used to help solve problems, increase efficiencies and improve overall business practices. Who doesn’t want a blend of great ideas from diverse people who will be motivated to enact those ideas and ultimately help your trucking company perform better?</p>

<p>Diversity and inclusion also look good to the public and to future candidates. It shows that your trucking company respects and values the benefits that diversity brings into the workplace. This respect is proven through inclusion by creating opportunities for growth and success.</p>

<h2>When should you plan to hire diverse truck drivers and staff?</h2>

<p>You can start today! The Great Resignation <a href=""https://www.pro-transport.com/insights/4-simple-ways-retain-drivers-and-reduce-turnover"">has put a dent in the number of truck drivers</a> out there, so if you’re hiring truck drivers, office staff and decision-makers you can consider diverse candidates more closely. If you’re not receiving any applications from diverse truck drivers, then you can start campaigns or initiatives to attract diverse candidates to your trucking company. Campaign ideas can include hiring bonuses, help paying for CDL licensing, employee-focused health and wellness initiatives and more. </p>

<h2>Why prioritize diversity for your trucking fleet?</h2>

<p>Most people want to work somewhere with others who look and think like them. This is the same for truck drivers, back-office staff and leadership in trucking companies. This reassures employees they are working for a trucking company they can trust who values their differences and takes their needs into consideration. Inclusion is just as important as diversity, and they work hand-in-hand to address the unique needs of your employees.</p>

<p>When candidates can’t see your efforts at diversity and inclusion, or if they don’t believe your efforts are cohesive and valid, they may turn down offers of employment or not apply at all. Unflattering rumors and a bad reputation regarding diversity in your trucking company can affect the outcome of your hiring efforts. If you have a diverse trucking fleet, you’re likely to attract other qualified and diverse truck drivers and candidates.</p>

1733,0,Blog Posts,The Difference Between Factoring and Quick Pay ,The Difference Between Factoring and Quick Pay ,"<p>You don’t need to wait a month or two (sometimes three) to get paid for a load. You have options. Depending on your needs and the needs of your company, you can opt to use quick pay on specific loads or freight factoring on all (or some) loads. They both help you get paid quickly after each load for the things your trucking company and drivers need, but they do this in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Common reasons trucking companies need faster, more reliable payment:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fuel for each load</li>
	<li>Driver salaries</li>
	<li>Maintenance costs</li>
	<li>Other operating costs</li>
</ul>

<p>With both factoring and quick pay, you get timely cash flow to spend on the things you need to fund your business instead of waiting for weeks or months. While you can use both factoring and quick-pay options, here are some differences to consider for both.</p>

<p><strong>What is Factoring?</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/what-factoring"">Factoring, trucking factoring or freight factoring</a>, means you sell an invoice to a factoring company who then advances you the majority of the invoiced amount. <a href=""http://www.rtsinc.com/articles/illustrated-guide-how-factoring-works"">Here’s how it works</a>: you deliver a load for a customer, and then you send your invoice to a factoring company instead of your customer. The factoring company sends you a cash advance typically within 24 hours and they collect full payment from your customer. The final step is that when the factoring company gets paid by your customer, they pay you the rest of the invoiced amount minus a small fee.</p>

<p>Freight factoring companies usually offer back-office perks and benefits like fuel card discounts, invoicing and collections, broker credit checks and other services that can benefit your trucking company. Most reputable factoring companies also offer web access to your account through a secure client portal and account representatives who can help you when you need it.</p>

<p><strong>What is Quick Pay?</strong></p>

<p>Quick pay for freight is handled by brokers who advance payment to the trucking company on an open invoice in exchange for a portion of the payment they take as their fee. This can be a good option, but it doesn’t provide consistent payment support. You are not likely to have an account to help keep track of your quick pay transactions. The main benefit of quick pay for trucking is that you get paid within one week.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the three categories where there are similarities and differences between factoring and quick pay.</p>

<p><strong>1. Time Frame: Both Get You Paid Fast</strong></p>

<p>Quick pay brokers offer payment on loads within one to seven days which is much quicker than the typical 30 to 60 days. With factoring though, you can consistently get paid the same-day or within 24 hours. Either way you’ll have money in the bank to keep your trucks on the road, but the stability and support of factoring provides consistent cash flow and helps improve operating efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>2. Rates: You Pay Varying Amounts in Service Fees</strong></p>

<p>The rates for the processing fee charged by quick pay brokers can range from 1% - 5%. As a trucking company, you will have to manage all the quick pays that are due from each broker, and each broker establishes their own terms and fees. This can be a lot to manage on your own. With factoring, your money comes from one company, so you don’t need to deal with multiple brokers. Your <a href=""http://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-much-does-invoice-factoring-cost"">factoring rate</a> will depend on a few specific details such as your industry, volume of invoices being processed and any debtor risk the factoring company takes on. </p>

<p><strong>3. Availability: Payment on Loads is Managed Differently </strong></p>

<p>Not all brokers offer quick pay, and if they do, they’ll only offer quick pay on their loads. This means you may limit yourself to hauling only certain types of loads from certain brokers if getting paid quickly is a priority for your business. Some brokers that offer quick pay services have loads that pay less than others you could find elsewhere. With factoring, you can submit invoices on all or some of your loads to one company instead of submitting to various brokers, and you can also submit multiple invoices at the same time for convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Factoring for Your Trucking Company</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You get paid faster more consistently - You'll get reliable same-day or next-day funding.</li>
	<li>There are options to reduce risk even further – Even if the customer you’re working with goes out of business or declares bankruptcy, you could still get paid (<a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/difference-between-recourse-and-non-recourse-factoring"">non-recourse factoring</a>).</li>
	<li>There will be less accounting for you to complete – Your factoring company will handle invoicing and collections and will provide additional reporting services.</li>
	<li>You can get free credit checks on your customers – Learn how creditworthy your customers are and if they typically pay on time.</li>
	<li>You can get unlimited funding through factoring – Factor as many invoices as you’d like while your business grows.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/six-quick-facts-about-factoring"">you get more than just faster pay</a> when working with a factoring company. The additional support, value, services and flexibility is often worth it and something that quick pay brokers simply don’t provide. <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/four-reasons-why-carriers-factor-rts-financial"">Get everything you need</a> from factoring to move your business forward.</p>

1743,0,Blog Posts,Understanding the Impact of High Diesel Fuel Prices ,Understanding the Impact of High Diesel Fuel Prices ,"<p><strong>Why Are Diesel Fuel Prices So High?</strong></p>

<p>Fuel prices for both gasoline and diesel have reached record highs, but diesel prices have surpassed gasoline by nearly $2.00/gallon. These fuel price hikes were caused in part by decades-low stockpiles and refinery outages. The war in Ukraine has also contributed significantly because of decreased access to fuel and increased demand for fuel supplied by the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>

<p><strong>How Are Diesel Prices Affecting Trucking Companies?</strong></p>

<p>The rapid increase in diesel fuel prices through 2022 is increasing operational costs for trucking companies, to the point that many are not generating enough revenue to cover fuel costs even with fuel surcharges. This makes it difficult to stay within profit margins.</p>

<p>After reevaluating their costs, many small trucking companies are taking more local loads and working overtime to meet their financial needs. Many trucking companies have tried introducing or increasing a fuel surcharge or freight charges to offset the increased diesel prices. Some trucking companies may still have to plan additional budget cuts and adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>High Diesel Fuel Prices Affect More Than the Trucking Industry</strong></p>

<p>Drivers, consumers and the overall economy are also at risk due to the high diesel fuel prices. Part of budget cuts may include pay cuts for drivers, resulting in some leaving the industry. Other companies might go out of business, or increase costs that result in a rise in the consumer price of goods. Other divisions of the economy that are driven by diesel fuel and may be experiencing a backlash due to diesel fuel prices include construction, manufacturing and agriculture.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to Offset Increased Diesel Prices</strong></p>

<p>Ways to help save on fuel and improve fuel habits include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Get a fuel card: </strong><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/product/fuel-discount-program"">Fuel cards can help you save at the pump</a> and track your fuel expenses.</li>
	<li><strong>Minimize bad driving habits: </strong>Driving faster than the speed limit or above your engine’s fuel efficiency can result in unnecessary increased fuel consumption.</li>
	<li><strong>Decrease idle time: </strong>Idling can waste gallons of fuel per hour.</li>
	<li><strong>Buy the right fuel: </strong>Stick with ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel; double check the fuel type at any station that isn’t clearly labeled as a truck stop.</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t forget aerodynamics: </strong><a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/guides/how-better-aerodynamics-lead-fuel-savings"">Lowering wind resistance through various techniques</a> can help lower your fuel costs.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep up with regular maintenance checks:</strong> Follow a preventative maintenance routine and check your miles per gallon at each fill to help track any fluctuations.</li>
	<li><strong>Check tire pressure weekly: </strong>Fill tires to the manufacturer’s specifications to <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-tires-affect-fuel-efficiency-trucking"">prevent rolling resistance</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Change shifting habits: </strong>Shift gears by revolutions per minute (RPM) not by the sound of the engine.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to Expect from Diesel Prices in the Coming Months </strong></p>

<p>Although there have been some months of declining fuel prices, diesel prices have dropped only slightly and jumped back up quickly. Diesel will likely maintain inflated prices while inventories remain low. Looking ahead, the diesel fuel prices are expected to worsen as we hit winter which is the peak of diesel season.</p>

1744,0,Blog Posts,Meal Prep Tips Every Truck Driver Should Know,Meal Prep Tips Every Truck Driver Should Know,"<p>If you’re a truck driver, life on the road can make <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/10-easy-ways-stay-healthy-road"">maintaining healthy habits</a> challenging. Oftentimes, convenience is prioritized over health, and truck-stop snacks make up the largest section of the food pyramid. Follow the practical meal prep ideas for truck drivers below to boost your nutrition, save time and money and cultivate a healthier relationship with food.</p>

<p><strong>Devote Time to Meal and Snack Prep</strong></p>

<p>Spending even a small amount of time preparing for the week ahead can make a big difference. Before your workweek starts, sit down and create a grocery list. Even if you just write down a few grab-and-go snack items that would be helpful to have on hand (e.g. nuts, string cheese, oatmeal, fruit, etc.), this exercise can help focus your trip to the grocery store. This brings us to our next tip…</p>

<p><strong>Visit the Grocery Store</strong></p>

<p>Don’t sacrifice your health for convenience. Taking a mindful trip to the grocery store once a week or every other week can save you from last-resort visits to the truck-stop food warmer. Set aside time to go to the grocery store and stock up on your favorites before you load into your truck, so you can have healthy and affordable options when you’re low on time.</p>

<p><strong>Start Small</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest meal prep pitfalls is trying to change too much too quickly. Instead of trying to change all your habits at once, start small. Pick a single recipe to meal prep that combines protein, grains and veggies, rather than selecting multiple recipes. Another option is to focus on one meal to start. For example, you could meal prep your breakfast for a week and keep your other meals the same. Bottom line: focusing on achieving small, manageable goals at the start will help motivate you to continue making healthy changes.</p>

<p><strong>Go With What You Like</strong></p>

<p>Go with options you know you like, and you know you’re more likely to eat. Too often when people start their on-the-road meal prep journey, they choose options they think they should be eating. Then, when cravings strike, they are less likely to be satisfied with what they have on hand. Instead, stock up on your preferred foods, so that you can satisfy your hunger pangs with your trusted favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Opt for Convenience</strong><br />
Starting small and simple can also apply to how you approach your food choices at the grocery store. Opting for convenient, pre-packaged food options can be a lifesaver, especially in the beginning stages of healthy meal prep for truck drivers. For example, you can buy sandwich supplies and pre-packaged salad kits for fast and simple, affordable options that are easy to prepare in your cab.</p>

<p><strong>Invest in Quality Containers</strong></p>

<p>Space and storage are key, especially when you’re operating in the confined space of a truck cab. Investing in a set of stackable food containers is an investment that will keep giving. Before you spend the money, make sure to do your research and consider how you will be using the containers and whether they need to be microwave- or freezer-safe.</p>

<p><strong>Set Aside Snacks</strong><br />
One of the best ways to combat unhealthy cravings is to set aside portioned snacks for your future self. Package individual servings of snacks like nuts, popcorn and granola in plastic bags, so that when the cravings kick in, you’ll have something to snack on, but you won’t go overboard on your portions.</p>

<p><strong>Keep Spices and Condiments on Hand</strong><br />
Condiments and spices can make or break a dish. That’s why it’s important to keep your favorites on hand. Not only do they have a long shelf life, but spices also tend to take up a small amount of space, which makes them ideal for storing in your truck.</p>

<p><strong>Cut up Fruits and Veggies at Home</strong><br />
Save time by cutting your fruits and veggies in batches at home, before you head out on the road. Pick colorful veggies that pair well with dips such as nut butter or hummus. Cutting veggies ahead of time can also help you more easily prepare meals in your cab with less cleanup.</p>

<p><strong>Look Before You Stop</strong></p>

<p>Of course, meal prep on the road isn’t always possible, and there are times when stopping at travel centers or truck stops for food is the only option. When this happens, it’s good to know your options and keep your health and nutrition top of mind. Do some research into places along your route with fresh grab-and-go options. Many leading travel centers like our partner, Pilot Flying J, offer fast and fresh food options for drivers that are designed to be healthy, nutritious and filling for long hours in the driver’s seat.</p>

1745,0,Blog Posts,Winter Safety Tips to Keep Your Truck on the Road ,Winter Safety Tips to Keep Your Truck on the Road ,"<p>Winter is quickly approaching, which means now is the time to prepare your truck for winter safety. Cold weather can be hard on your truck’s engine and other vehicle components, which can be dangerous while you’re on the road. For those driving from a warmer climate to a cold climate, it’s important to prepare your truck for winter so you’re not left with a high maintenance bill from servicing a truck that has frozen over.</p>

<p>Here are 11 winter safety tips to help you begin preparations for driving during the cold season.</p>

<p><strong>1. Avoid Parking Your Truck in the Cold for More Than 24 Hours</strong></p>

<p>Whenever possible, avoid leaving your truck out in the cold for long periods of time. This can cause what is known as an engine cold soak. The components and fluids in the engine begin to freeze, and it may take a while to get the truck warmed up again if it has been sitting for more than a day.</p>

<p><strong>2. Maintain Good Tire Health</strong></p>

<p>It’s important to check tire pressure throughout winter since cold weather can decrease tire pressure. Low tire pressure means that rolling resistance will increase and your fuel economy will decrease. You should also keep an eye on the tire treads because low tread will decrease traction. This is worsened by icy and snow-covered roads, but switching to snow tires or using chains can help. Ensure that your tires receive regular balance and alignment checks.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use an Engine Block Heater in Extreme Winter Temperatures</strong></p>

<p>Before the temperature drops below zero degrees Fahrenheit, it’s time to plug in the engine block heater. This helps the oil in the engine block maintain fluidity so the truck will run more efficiently. If the oil begins to congeal due to low temperatures, the engine has to work harder since the oil isn’t moving properly. In this case, the truck will use more fuel and produce more emissions. To be proactive, once the temperature hits five degrees Fahrenheit, it’s a good idea to start using the engine block heater. Ensure that your engine block heater remains functional with proper maintenance checks.</p>

<p><strong>4. Make Sure All Lights are Functional</strong></p>

<p>Check that all lights are functional and replace those that are no longer working. You want to ensure visibility on dark, snowy days.</p>

<p><strong>5. Check Your Battery</strong></p>

<p>Your battery will need to work harder to function alongside a cold engine, and too much heat from overworking can damage the battery. Cold weather makes the battery drain quickly and makes it harder to charge. Before winter hits, make sure your battery is not past its expiration date. You need it in optimal condition to hold a charge, and you’ll also want to clean the connections regularly to keep the battery functioning properly.</p>

<p><strong>6. Keep at Least Half a Tank of Winterized Fuel</strong></p>

<p>A half-full tank can prevent condensation from building up in the tank itself, which then keeps fuel lines from freezing in cold temperatures. Also, if you’re ever broken down, stranded or stuck in traffic, you’ll have half a tank of fuel to keep your truck running and to keep you warm.</p>

<p>Winterized or seasonally-enhanced fuel will help your engine run in extreme cold weather. This type of fuel prevents fuel gelling, frozen fuel lines and blocked filters from build-up during the winter season. Winterized fuel can handle temperatures as low as -30 degrees Fahrenheit and helps maintain better fuel economy than using regular diesel in cold weather.</p>

<p><strong>7. Inspect Your Windshield Wiper Blades</strong></p>

<p>The beginning of winter may be the best time to have your windshield wipers replaced. You’ll need your wiper blades to function at peak performance since they’ll be wiping away freezing rain, sleet, snow and ice build-up.</p>

<p><strong>8. Check Fluid Levels</strong></p>

<p>The fluids that need to be measured during winter safety checks are engine oil, brake fluid, transmission fluid, coolant, power steering fluid and windshield washer fluid. Make sure these fluids are topped off before you begin your winter driving. Your fuel economy can be impacted if your fluids aren’t replenished regularly. It’s also important to keep water out of your fluid systems since water will freeze and cause problems.</p>

<p><strong>9. Remove Ice and Snow from Your Truck</strong></p>

<p>Built up ice on your rig can fall off during travel and cause damage to the cars behind you. The best winter safety practice is to remove all snow from your cabin roof, trailer and other parts of your truck where snow has settled. Many states have a law requiring you to remove snow from your truck before travelling to avoid becoming a winter safety hazard.</p>

<p><strong>10. Check Your Brakes</strong></p>

<p>It’s important to ensure that your brakes are working as they should, especially if you have air brakes, which are vulnerable during cold weather. Any moisture in the air system can freeze and prevent your truck from stopping properly.</p>

<p><strong>11. Check Your Defrost and Heat</strong></p>

<p>Ensure that your HVAC system’s defrost and heat are keeping up with the chill for those bitterly cold days. Heat and defrost are important to keep you warm and to keep your windows clear before getting on the road in cold weather.</p>

<p>Don’t just rely on these tips for winter safety; always take your truck to be serviced by professionals to get it ready for the cold weather. If you will be driving in cold weather for long periods of time, make sure you regularly keep an eye on the items mentioned in these winter safety tips. We want all drivers to be safe on the road and winter ready.</p>

1749,0,Blog Posts,5 Ways to Prepare for Your Next Weigh Station Stop,5 Ways to Prepare for Your Next Weigh Station Stop,"<p>DOT and highway patrol want to ensure that the load you’re hauling isn’t too heavy. A load that exceeds the maximum weight can damage roads and bridges and result in fines for being overloaded. This is the main purpose for weigh stations, but they also allow each truck driver to be inspected for other issues that may prevent them from hauling safely on the road.</p>

<p>You must pass the weigh-in and inspections before you can leave the weigh station and get back on the road. If there are any issues, you could be held up at the weigh station for hours. You can avoid this inconvenience by following these tips and preparing before your next weigh station stop.</p>

<p><strong>1. Inspect Your Truck and Load Before You Begin Your Drive</strong></p>

<p>It is always good practice to perform a pre-check inspection on your truck and your load before you get on the road. This practice will help you succeed during weigh station inspections as you will be aware of the status of your truck and your load.</p>

<p>When you do arrive at a weigh station, your truck inspection will often include the following depending on your inspection level:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fuel tanks</li>
	<li>Tires/wheels</li>
	<li>Brakes</li>
	<li>Tubing/hoses</li>
	<li>Springs</li>
	<li>Kingpin</li>
	<li>Truck leaks</li>
	<li>Other inspectable items</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing that your truck and load are safe before you arrive at a weigh station can help you get through the inspection process with little to worry about.</p>

<p><strong>2. Be Prepared for Logging Device and Safety Checks</strong></p>

<p>After your weigh-in there will likely be an inspection of your <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/eight-most-common-questions-about-elds"">electronic logging device (ELD)</a> to ensure compliance with hours-of-service regulations. Equipment may also be inspected during your weigh station stop to ensure that it’s all available and functional. Your DOT number will be entered into a computer system comparing your information to a database for motor carrier <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/what-dot-safety-rating"">safety ratings</a> and scores.</p>

<p><strong>3. Drive Safely on the Road and Through the Weigh Station</strong></p>

<p>Speeding is never advisable, so drive the speed limit on the road and slow down to the appropriate speed as you enter the weigh station. You must also follow the speed guidelines for entry onto the scale where you may be asked to drive over the scale completely or you may be required to stop to provide a weight for each axle. There may also be slowing and stopping instructions for getting around the weigh station.</p>

<p><strong>4. Follow the Rules and Cooperate During Your Weigh Station Stop</strong></p>

<p>There will be weighing and inspections in progress when you pull into the weigh station, and all these activities require the oversight of a transportation officer. If a transportation officer asks you to do, or not to do, something, be sure that you comply. You may be frustrated by the delay, but following instructions and being compliant will keep the process moving smoothly for everyone and keep the inconveniences at a minimum.</p>

<p><strong>5. Do the Right Thing</strong></p>

<p>The weigh station could have a long line since there are so many commercial trucks on the road that need to be weighed. The wait for your turn could put you behind schedule. If you choose to skip the weigh station without authorization, you may find yourself pulled over by law enforcement officers who often wait near the highway re-entry ramp of the weigh station. You could end up with a ticket and orders to return to the weigh station to complete the process. More extreme penalties include fines or even jail time.</p>

<p>There is a legal way to bypass weigh stations if you’re qualified to do so. If eligible, you may be able to use a bypass pre-clearance device to potentially bypass specific weigh stations along your route.</p>

1764,0,Blog Posts,How to Avoid Common Mistakes As a New Trucker,How to Avoid Common Mistakes As a New Trucker,"<p>Thousands of people join the trucking industry every year, and we’ve put together recommendations that will help you avoid some of the most common mistakes new carriers tend to make.</p>

<h2>Safety First</h2>

<p>Creating safety-conscious habits early in your trucking career can help you avoid common safety violations. You can start safety-focused practices before you even hit the road by conducting regular vehicle maintenance, familiarizing yourself with weight limits and checking the weather and road conditions before each trip. Once on the road, be sure to adhere to highway safety practices, like following speed limits and using proper signaling, that can prevent putting you and others on the road in danger.</p>

<h2>Keep Your Paperwork Organized</h2>

<p>There are a lot of things to keep track of as an owner-operator, and making sure everything is organized is important. From fuel purchase receipts and load paperwork to maintenance records and driver qualification files, maintaining proper documentation and organization will lead to better operations overall. Adversely, not keeping organized files can lead to failed DOT inspections, messy and time-consuming fuel tax calculations and even lost income and business. Whether you use Excel spreadsheets, a trucking app like <a href=""https://rtspro.com/"">RTS Pro</a> or <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/what-trucking-dispatch-software"">trucking software</a>, keep your physical and digital documents organized and easy to find so you can access them quickly when you need them.</p>

<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>

<p>Not taking care of your health can have serious implications for you and your career. According to the FMCSA, nearly 350,000 drivers were disqualified in 2021 because they failed their <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-prepare-dot-physical"">DOT physicals</a>. Things like maintaining a <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/road-meal-prep-tips-every-truck-driver-should-know"">healthy diet</a>, taking necessary medications on time every time and following basic healthcare recommendations like staying hydrated can help keep you healthy on and off the road.</p>

<h2>Get Enough Sleep</h2>

<p>When you neglect your sleep, you put yourself and others at risk. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, almost 100,000 motor vehicle accidents occur per year because of sleep deprivation, and over 50% of crashes caused by commercial truck drivers are a result of extreme fatigue. Get plenty of sleep, take breaks when needed and remember, being tired while driving puts you and others at risk. A good driver knows their limits, so be sure to take care of yourself and get the rest you need to function properly and operate your truck safely.</p>

<h2>Plan When and Where to Fuel Up</h2>

<p>Not knowing when and where to fuel up can cost you money. Fuel is heavy, and each gallon weighs roughly six pounds, so avoid any extra charges by fueling up after the weigh station. Where you fuel up is equally important. You can use a trucking app to search along your route for the best deals and discounts on diesel. You can also familiarize yourself with IFTA and utilize <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/finding-and-using-fuel-taxes-state"">fuel planning</a> to take advantage of fuel tax rates across state lines and maximize potential savings.</p>

<h2>Be Aware of Your Trailer</h2>

<p>Too often, new drivers fail to understand the size and weight of their trailer. It can be easy to misjudge turning space, the distance between you and other vehicles and the clearing height between the top of your trailer and tunnels or bridges. Be sure to take your time, move at a cautious speed, leave space between you and other vehicles and always check your surroundings.</p>

<h2>Take Measures to Prevent Cargo Theft</h2>

<p>Cargo theft is among the top concerns of truckers everywhere. As a best practice, try to avoid leaving your loaded trailer unattended, whenever possible, and especially in areas of higher cargo theft. Be sure to lock your trailer (e.g., air cuff locks, rear door locks, etc.). If staging or dropping a load is unavoidable, consider also installing landing gear locks. For more tips on preventing cargo theft, read <a href=""https://www.rtsinc.com/articles/how-prevent-cargo-theft"">How to Prevent Cargo Theft</a>.</p>

1765,0,Blog Posts,How to Prevent Cargo Theft,How to Prevent Cargo Theft,"<p>Cargo theft is among the top concerns of truckers everywhere. After a long day of driving, trying to find safe parking and staying on top of your business operations, it can be difficult to keep securing your freight top of mind.</p>

<h2>What is Cargo Theft?</h2>

<p>There are two main types of cargo theft you should watch out for: hijacking and pilferage. Hijacking is when someone steals your loaded trailer and drives off with it. Pilferage, on the other hand, is when an individual or group breaks into your trailer, steals what they can carry and leaves the scene afterward.</p>

<p><strong>The top stolen commodities in the U.S. include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Household goods</li>
	<li>Food and beverages</li>
	<li>Vehicles and accessories</li>
	<li>Electronics</li>
	<li>Base metals</li>
	<li>Apparel</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the tips below to decrease your chances of being a target for any type of cargo theft.</p>

<h2>Lock It Up</h2>

<p>Let’s start out with a simple reminder: lock your cargo. A lock and key can be a great deterrent for cargo thieves, as they commonly strike at the sight of an opportunity. They are more likely to go for an open container, so any lock (e.g., landing gear locks, air cuff locks, rear door locks, etc.) can help deter them from approaching your truck.</p>

<h2>Look Around</h2>

<p>A common strategy cargo thieves use is criminal surveillance; they wait, follow a truck out of the facility and steal the cargo when the truck stops. Since most criminal surveillance occurs within a mile of the load origin, be aware and look for occupied vehicles parked outside shipping facilities. When leaving, look for a group of following vehicles or a vehicle with multiple adults riding together (especially in a van, pickup or SUV, since they have more space to fit the stolen cargo). Stay vigilant and pay attention to your surroundings, especially for the first few miles of your route.</p>

<h2>Keep Driving</h2>

<p>After picking up your load, drive for at least 200 miles before stopping. The further out you are from the shipping facility, the less likely thieves will be to track your vehicle. To prepare for an uninterrupted drive, get yourself and your vehicle ready before pickup by fueling, inspecting, eating and anything else you need to do before picking up your load.</p>

<h2>Park Wisely</h2>

<p>After driving for at least 200 miles, start thinking about a safe parking space. Make sure to choose a well-lit parking lot, and, if you can, back up your trailer against a building or fence to make it difficult for thieves to open the trailer doors. Cargo thieves monitor dark and secluded parking lots early in the morning before employees arrive, so it’s best to arrive to your destination when it is open. If you absolutely need to leave your trailer without supervision, survey your surroundings outside before and after you come back to check for any signs of security breaches. Your parking strategy can save you from becoming a cargo theft victim.</p>

<h2>Think Wisely Before You Share</h2>

<p>Remember that anyone can go after your cargo, including maintenance personnel, facility workers, waitresses or a fellow truck driver. Even people you cannot see can be a threat and gain valuable information from social media or CB radio conversations. To further protect your cargo and equipment, make sure to only discuss your loads, routes, times and destinations with individuals who need to know.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it’s important to remember the dangers of cargo theft. Only by understanding the risks can you fully protect yourself and your fellow truck drivers. Following the tips above can dramatically decrease your chances of falling victim to cargo theft.</p>
